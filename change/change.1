.TH CHANGE 1 "01/04/22" "J\*org Schilling" "Schily\'s USER COMMANDS"
.SH NAME
change \- non interactive editor to change patterns in files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
change [
.B options
]
.B from to 
[
.I file1 .\|.\|. filen
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Change
substitutes the
.I from
string or pattern by the
.I to
string or pattern.
.PP
.B Change
uses the same pattern matcher as
.BR match .
If a pattern contains special characters from the pattern
matcher, these characters must be preceded by a backslash '\\'.
It is a good idea to put strings in single quotes if they
contain special characters from the pattern matcher.
This prevents the shell from treating such a string and eating
up the quote characters before they are seen by
.BR change.
.PP
If the character '&' appears in the
.IR to_string ,
it replaces what has matched in the
.IR from_string .
Multiple occurrences of '&' are possible.
.PP
.B Change
by default creates backup files similar to
.BR ved .
The old file is renamed to 
.I xxx.bak
and a new file with the old name and old permissions is created.
If the
.B \-nobak
option is present, the old file is removed and a new file is created.
.PP
The file is treated line by line. If a pattern occurs more than once
on a single line, all occurrences of that pattern are changed unless
the 
.B \-#
option is present.
.PP
If no file names are present, 
.B change
operates as filter from 
.B stdin
to
.BR stdout .
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v
Be verbose: Displays lines before they are changed.
.TP
.B \-c
Displays lines after they are changed.
.TP
.B \-i
Interactive prompting for each change
.TP
.B \-#
Maximum number of changes per line
.TP
.B \-nobak
Do not create a 
.I xxx.bak
file with the old content.
.TP
.B \-help
Prints a short summary of the 
.B change
options and exists.
.TP
.B \-version
Prints the 
.B change
version number string and exists.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR match (1)
.SH NOTES
.PP
If no match for the 
.I from_pattern
occurs in a file, it is not changed and the time stamp of that
file is not affected. If 
.B change 
is used on several source files, this help the
.B make
program to know that only the changed files need to be recompiled.
.PP
If a file with more than name is changed, a new file is created.
The new file is no more linked to the other files and the content
of the other files is not changed.
.PP
See
.BR match (1)
for a detailed description of allowed patterns.
