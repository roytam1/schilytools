# Uncomment this to set star's default FIFO size (e.g. the value that is used
# when no fs= option is present on the star command line).
#
#STAR_FIFOSIZE=		32m

#
# Uncomment this to set star's MAX FIFO size.
# This tag may be used to limit the FIFO size used by star to a certain value
# even if the fs= option on the command line would request for more FIFO.
# This makes sense if you like to have a unique backup script that requests
# e.g. 256 MB if FIFO but one of the backup client machines only has 128 MB
# of RAM.
#
#STAR_FIFOSIZE_MAX=	100m

#
# In former times, enabling fsync() for each extracted file was only a problem
# on platforms with extremely inefficient filesystem buffer cache (e.g. Linux).
# With UFS on Solaris, enabling fsync() for each extracted file makes tar
# extraction approx. 10% slower. With ext4 on Linux, this makes tar extraction
# approx. 400% slower and with btrfs on Linux it makes tar extraction approx.
# 2000% slower.
#
# Now on Solaris, we have ZFS and ZFS implements transactional filesystem
# safety, but as a result of it's copy on write concepts, it is very expensive
# if we request a specific state of the filesystem at a given time. With ZFS
# on Solaris, enabling fsync() for each extracted file makes tar extraction
# approx. 400% slower.
#
# If you are on a platform with a fair filesystem buffer performance
# (e.g. Solaris) and do not use ZFS, you should comment out the next statement
# that switches off fsync() by default. Only by enabling fsync() for each
# extracted file, star may tell whether a file extraction has been successful.
#
STAR_FSYNC=N

#
# If you are frequently doing administrative work and you know that you do not
# extract alien tar archives, you may uncomment the following line to tell star
# to extract potentially insecure links by default. Since this sets a global
# default, it is recommended to rather use a user specific default via the
# environment.
#
#STAR_SECURE_LINKS=N

# Compatibility entries for Sun's tar. There are up to four entries per line:
#
#	1)	The device name
#	2)	The blocking factor in units of 512 bytes
#	3)	The max media size in 1024 byte units 
#		0 means unlimited (no multi volume handling) 
#	4)	Whether this is a tape or not ('n' or 'N' means no tape).
