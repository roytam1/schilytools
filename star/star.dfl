# Uncomment this to set star's default FIFO size (e.g. the value that is used
# when no fs= option is present on the star command line).
#
#STAR_FIFOSIZE=		32m

#
# Uncomment this to set star's MAX FIFO size.
# This tag may be used to limit the FIFO size used by star to a certain value
# even if the fs= option on the command line would request for more FIFO.
# This makes sense if you like to have a unique backup script that requests
# e.g. 256 MB if FIFO but one of the backup client machines only has 128 MB
# of RAM.
#
#STAR_FIFOSIZE_MAX=	100m

#
# Compatibility entries for Sun's tar. There are up to four entries per line:
#
#	1)	The device name
#	2)	The blocking factor in units of 512 bytes
#	3)	The max media size in 1024 byte units 
#		0 means unlimited (no multi volume handling) 
#	4)	Whether this is a tape or not ('n' or 'N' means no tape).
