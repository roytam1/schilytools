Note that the test tar archives used for this conformance test are bzip2
compressed. This has been done because it is the only widely available
compression format that allows to compress several gigabytes of nulls
into a few bytes.

A recent version of the files is always on:

The file 'ustar-big-2g.tar.bz2' contains a file with the largest size that
a historic tar implementation is able to understand.

The file 'ustar-big-8g.tar.bz2' contains a file with the largest size that
may be used with the ustar (POSIX.1-1990 tar) format.

The file 'pax-big-10g.tar.bz2' contains a file with size 1 GB.
This file may only be represented using the new POSIX.1-2001 extended tar
format using extended headers. This extended archive format has been called
PAX.

star: Total time 563.352sec (18613 kBytes/sec)

Only a POSIX.1-2001 conforming program will be able to read the archive
correctly. For now, June 2002 star seems to be the only POSIX.1-2001 conforming
TAR program.
