.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B scpio
utility, depending on the options used:
.TP
.B \(bu
copies files to an archive file
.TP
.B \(bu
extracts files from an archive file
.TP
.B \(bu
lists files from an archive file
.TP
.B \(bu
copies files from one directory tree to another.
. \" .SH RETURNS
. \" .SH ERRORS
.SH OPTIONS
The
.B scpio
utility supports the XBD specification Utility Syntax
Guidelines. The 
.B cpio 
standard does not allow
the option modifiers to be presented as
separate arguments from the option letters.
The
.B scpio
implementation allows option modifiers to be presented as
separate arguments from the option letters. When writing
portable shell scripts do never make use of this feature.
.PP
The following options are supported:
.TP
.B \-o
(Copy Out.) Read the standard input to obtain a list of
pathnames and copy those files onto the standard output
together with pathname and status information. Output is
padded to a 512-byte boundary.
.TP
.B \-i
(Copy In.) Extract files from the standard input, which is
assumed to be the product of a previous
.BR "scpio \-o" .
Only files
with names that match
.I patterns
are selected. The extracted
files are conditionally created and copied into the current
directory tree based upon the options described below. The
permissions of the files will be those of the previous
.BR "scpio \-o" .
The owner and group of the files will be that of the
current user unless the user has appropriate privileges,
which causes
.B scpio
to retain the owner and group of the files
of the previous
.BR "scpio \-o" .
If the archive being read does not
match the modifier specified,
.B scpio
may consider this to be an
error and exit or may recognise the archive and continue
processing. Only a user with appropriate privileges can
extract block special or character special files from an
archive.
.TP
.B \-it
(List.) List files from the archive. This is a sub mode of the
copy in mode, no files are created in list mode.
.TP
.B \-p
(Pass.) Read the standard input to obtain a list of pathnames
of files that are conditionally created and copied into the
destination directory tree based upon the option modifiers
described below.
.PP
The following option modifiers can be appended in any sequence to
the
.BR \-o ", " \-i " or " \-p
options:
.TP
.B a
Reset access times of input files after they have been
copied. (When option
.B l
(see below) is also specified, the
access times of the linked files are not reset.)
.TP
.B B
Block input/output 5120 bytes to the record (does not apply
to the
.B \-p
option; meaningful only with data directed to or
from character special files).
.TP
.B d
Create directories as needed.
.TP
.B c
Write or read header information in character form for
portability.
Note that the Open Group standard does not specify the archive
format that should be used with the
.B c
option.
For this reason it is questionable wether the
.B c
option increases portability in general.
.sp
The archive format used by
.B scpio
with the
.B c
option is the format from the
.B "\-H asc
option.
It gives best
.B cpio
compatibility when transferring files to SVR4-based systems
(except that the file size is limited to 2\ gigabytes).
When transferring files in
.B cpio
archives to unknown operating systems, it is unwise to use the
.BR c "\ option.
.TP
.B r
Interactively rename files. For each archive member matching
.I pattern
operand, a prompt will be written to the file
.BR /dev/tty .
The prompt will contain the name of the archive
member, but the format is otherwise unspecified. A line will
then be read from 
.BR /dev/tty .
If this line is blank, the
archive member will be skipped. If this line consists of a
single period, the archive member will be processed with no
modification to its name. Otherwise, its name will be
replaced with the contents of the line. The
.B scpio
utility will
immediately exit with a non-zero exit status if end-of-file is
encountered when reading a response, or if
.B /dev/tty
cannot be
opened for reading and writing.
.TP
.B t
Write a table of contents of the input. No files are created.
.TP
.B u
Copy unconditionally (normally, an older file will not
replace a newer file with the same name).
.TP
.B v
Verbose: print the names of the affected files. With the
.B t
option, provides a detailed listing.
.TP
.B l
Whenever possible, link files rather than copying them.
Usable only with the
.B \-p
option.
The
.B l
option modifier is not yet supported by
.BR scpio .

.TP
.B m
Retain previous file modification time. This option is
ineffective on directories that are being copied.
.TP
.B f
Copy in all files except those in
.IR patterns .

.PP
The following 
.I "other options
are implemented as 
.B SVr4 compliant
extension to the Open Group standard:
.PP
.TP
.B \-6
Extract
.B UNIX System Sixth Edition
cpio archives. This option is not valid in archive create mode,
it is mutually exclusive with
.BR \-c ,
.BR \-H ,
and
.BR artype= .
As is is unclear how
.B UNIX System Sixth Edition
cpio archives look like, this option is currently unsupported.
.TP
.B \-@
Include extended file attributes in the archive.
This option is currently unsupported.
.TP
.B \-A
Append files to an existing archive.
The
.B \-A
option only works together with the
.B \-O 
option.
See
.B star -r
for more information.
.TP
.B \-b
Reverses the order of the bytes within each word.
It is unclear what a
.I word
is supposed to be.
This option is unsupported but not needed as
.B scpio
includes automatic byte order recognition.
.TP
.BI \-C " #
Sets (input/output) archive block size to # bytes.
.TP
.BI \-E " name
Read filenames for store/create/list command from
.IR name .
The file
.I name
must contain a list of filenames, each on a separate line.
.TP
.BI \-H " header
Set the archive type to
.IR header .
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.BI \-I " nm
Use
.I nm
as archive file name instead of stdin.
.TP
.B \-k
Try to skip corrupt archive headers.
.TP
.B \-L
Follow symbolic links as if they were files.
.TP
.BI \-M " message
Define a message that is uses when switching media.
This option is currently unsupported.
.TP
.BI \-O " nm
Use
.I nm
as archive file name instead of stdout.
.TP
.B \-P
Handle 
.B Access Control List
(ACL) information in create and extract mode.
See
.B star -acl
for more information.
.TP
.BI \-R " nm
Reassign ownership and group for all files based on
.IR nm .
This option is currently unsupported.
.TP
.B \-s
Reverses the order of the bytes within each word.
It is unclear what a
.I word
is supposed to be.
This option is unsupported but not needed as
.B scpio
includes automatic byte order recognition.
.TP
.B \-S
Reverses the order of the halfwords within each word.
It is unclear what a
.I word
is supposed to be.
This option is unsupported but not needed as
.B scpio
includes automatic byte order recognition.
.TP
.B \-V
Special verbose. Print a dot for each file that is read or written.
This option is currently unsupported.
.PP
The following 
.I "other options
are implemented as 
.B star
extension to the Open Group standard:
.TP
.B \-help
Prints a summary of the most important options for
.BR scpio (1)
and exits.
.TP
.B \-xhelp
Prints a summary of the less important options for
.BR scpio (1)
and exits.
.TP
.B \-version
Prints the 
.B scpio
version number string and exists.
.TP
.B \-/
Don't strip leading slashes from file names when extracting an archive.  
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B ..
Don't skip files that contain /../ in the name.
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-7z
run the input or output through a
.B p7zip
pipe - see option
.B \-z
below.
.sp
Note that the
.B p7zip
program currently does not operate on a pipe but on a
/tmp file copy and thus limits the maximum archive size.

.TP
.B \-acl
Handle 
.B Access Control List
(ACL) information in create and extract mode.
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.BI artype= header
Set the archive type to
.IR header .
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-lzo
Run the input or output through a
.B lzop
pipe - see option
.B \-z
below.
.TP
.B \-bz
Run the input or output through a
.B bzip2
pipe - see option
.B \-z
below. As the
.B \-bz
the
.B \-z
options are non standard, it makes sense to omit
.B \-bz  
options the inside shell scripts.
If you are going to extract a compressed archive that is located
inside a plain file,
.B scpio
will auto detect compression and choose the right
decompression option to extract.
.TP
.BI bs= #
Set block size to #. You may use the same method as in
.BR dd (1)
and
.BR sdd (1). 
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-fifostats
Print fifo statistics at the end of a
.B scpio
run when the fifo has been in effect.
.TP
.BI fs= #
Set fifo size to #.
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-no\-fifo
Do not use a fifo to optimize data flow from/to tape.
See 
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-no\-fsync
Do not call
.BR fsync (2)
for each file that has been extracted from the archive.
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-do\-fsync
Call
.BR fsync (2)
for each file that has been extracted from the archive.
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-no-statistics
Do not print statistic messages at the end of a
.B scpio
run.
.TP
.B \-secure\-links
Do not extract hard links or symbolic links if the link
name (the target of the link) starts with a slash (/)
or if /../ is contained in the link name. 
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-numeric
Use the numeric user/group fields in the listing rather than the default.
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B \-time
Print timing info.
See
.BR star (1)
for more information.
.TP
.B -xfflags
Store and extract extended file flags as found on BSD
and Linux systems.
See
.B star -acl
for more information.
.TP
.B \-z
Run the input or output through a
.B gzip
pipe - see option
.B \-bz
above. As the
.B \-bz
the
.B \-z
options are non standard, it makes sense to omit
.B \-bz  
options the inside shell scripts.
If you are going to extract a compressed archive that is located
inside a plain file,
.B scpio
will auto detect compression and choose the right
decompression option to extract.
.TP
.B \-zstd
run the input or output through a
.B zstd
pipe - see option
.B \-z
above.

.SH OPERANDS
.PP
The following operands are supported:
.TP
.I directory
A pathname of an existing directory to be used as the target
of
.BR "scpio \-p" .
.TP
.I pattern
Expressions making use of a pattern-matching notation similar
to that used by the shell for filename pattern matching, and
similar to regular expressions. The following metacharacters
are defined:
.RS
.TP
.B "*"
Matches any string, including the empty string.
.TP
.B "?"
Matches any single character.
.TP
.B "[...]"
Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of
characters separated by `-' matches any symbol between
the pair (inclusive), as defined by the system default
collating sequence. If the first character following the
opening `[' is a `!', the results are unspecified.
.PP
In
.IR pattern ,
the special characters "?", "*" and "[" also
match the "/" character. Multiple cases of
.I pattern
can be
specified and if no
.I pattern
is specified, the default for
.I pattern
is "*" (that is, select all files).
.PP
Note that
.B scpio
does not use
.BR fnmatch (3)
based pattern matching as documented above,
it rather uses the pattern matcher documented in
.BR match (1).
.RE
.SH STDIN
.PP
When the
.BR \-o " or " \-p
options are used, the standard input is a text
file containing a list of pathnames, one per line, to be copied.
.PP
When the
.B \-i
option is used, the standard input is an archive file
formatted in any way that is understood by the archive handling
engine (see
.B "\-H help
option for a complete list).
.SH "INPUT FILES
.PP
The files identified by the pathnames in the standard input are of
any type.
.PP
When the
.B \-r
option is used, the file
.B /dev/tty
is used to write
prompts and read responses.
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS
.PP
Default.
.SH STDOUT
When the
.B \-o
option is used, the standard output is an archive file
formatted as specified by
.B pax
with the
.B "\-x cpio
option. For better compatibility with SVR4-based systems that
do not implement the 
.B cpio
format correctly,
.B scpio
by default limits the length of file names to 256 bytes.
Use 
.B "scpio \-H cpio
to explicitly switch to the full POSIX 1003.1-1988
.B cpio
archive format.
.PP
Otherwise,
the standard output contains commentary in an unspecified format
concerning the progress of the execution.
.SH STDERR
When the
.B \-o
option is not used, the standard error contains
commentary in an unspecified format concerning the progress of the
execution. Otherwise, the standard error is used only for
diagnostic messages.
.SH "OUTPUT FILES
Output files are created, as specified by the archive, when the
.B \-i
or
.B \-p
options are used.
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION
.PP
None.

.SH "EXIT STATUS
.PP
The following exit values are returned:
.TP
.B 0
Successful completion.
.TP
.B >0
An error occurred.
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS
.PP
If a file or directory cannot be created or overwritten,
.B scpio
continues with the next file in the archive or file to be added to
the archive.

.SH "APPLICATION USAGE
.PP
Archives created by
.B scpio
are portable between XSI-conformant
systems provided the same procedures are used.
.PP
The shell metacharacter notation is not fully compatible with that
used by the shell and the
.B pax
utility. Not all systems support the
use of the negation character [! ...] in
.B cpio
patterns. Portable
applications must avoid the use of this notation.
.PP
For portable communication of data between XSI-conformant systems,
it is recommended that only characters defined in the
ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard International Reference Version
(equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range of characters be used and that
only characters defined in the Portable Filename Character Set be
used for naming files. This recommendation is given because
XSI-conformant systems support diverse codesets and run in various
geographical areas and there is no single, well-established
codeset that incorporates all of the characters of the languages
of the various geographical areas.
.PP
The
.B cpio
archive format only supports file sizes up to 8\ gigabytes.
.PP
Applications should migrate to the
.B pax
archive format which is the POSIX 1003.1-2001 standard archive format
and based on an extended
.B tar
format.

.SH "FUTURE DIRECTIONS
None.

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
1. Copy the contents of a directory onto an archive:
.PP
.B          ls | scpio -o >../cpio.out
.PP
2. Duplicate a directory hierarchy:
.PP
.B          cd olddir
.br
.B          find . -depth -print | scpio -pd ../newdir

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
The following environment variables may affect the execution of
.BR scpio :
.TP
.B TZ
Determine the timezone used with date and time strings.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.SH NOTES
.PP
The default block size for

is 512 bytes, this slows down write speed.
Use

.PP
.B "Scpio -iu
is equivalent to
.B "star \-xU \-install \-force\-remove \-remove\-recursive
and for this reason may remove nonempty directory trees in extrace mode
without printing a warning.
