.SH DESCRIPTION
.B cpp
is the C language preprocessor. This implementation does not implement the
ANSI C standard but K&R.
. \" .SH RETURNS
. \" .SH ERRORS
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-C
Pass all comments (except those that appear on lines with 
.B cpp
directives) to the output.
The default is to suppress C-style comments.
.TP
.B \-H
Print the path names of include files on standard error.
Each name is printed on a separate line, names may appear more than once.
.TP
.B \-M
Generates a list of dependencies and
write them to the output.
This list is in makefile format and indicates that the related
.B .o
file depends on the input file and the used include files.
.TP
.B \-P
Do not include line control information in the preprocessor output.
.TP
.B \-R
Allow recursive macros.
.TP
.B \-T
Only check for the first eight characters in macro names.
This option allows backwards compatibility with old systems
that only check for the first eight characters.
.TP
.B \-noinclude
Remove the standard system include directory (usually
.BR /usr/include )
from the search path.
.TP
.B \-undef
Remove all initially predefined macros.
.TP
.B \-xsc
Character constants are treated as
.B signed char
regardless of the default in the compiler.
.TP
.B \-xuc
Character constants are treated as
.B unsigned char
regardless of the default in the compiler.
.TP
.BI \-D name
Defines 
.I name
as 1. This option has the same effect as if a
.IP
.RS
.BI #define " name " 1
.RE
.IP
line was in the input file.
.TP
.BI \-D name = val
Defines 
.I name
as
.IR val.
This option has the same effect as if a
.IP
.RS
.BI #define " name " val
.RE
.IP
line was in the input file.
.TP
.BI \-I directory
Adds
.I directory
to the search path for
.B #include
directives.
.TP
.BI \-U name
Remove an initial definition of
.IR name .
.TP
.BI \-Y directory
Uses
.I directory
instead of the standard system include directory.

.SH NOTES
ANSI C preprocessors replace an escaped NEWLINE (a backslash that
is immediately followed by a NEWLINE) with a SPACE. This implementation
keeps backslash NEWLINE intact.
