.SH NAME
streamarchive \- StreamArchive file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B StreamArchive
typed archives are a series of
.B keyword
and
.B value
records that are similar to content of the 
POSIX.1-2001 extended headers called
.BR "TAR (PAX) HEADERs" .
.LP
A new file always begins with the
.B path
keyword and after the mandatory
.B size
keyword, file content may follow.
Each file record is terminated by a
.B status
keyword.
.LP
An archive begins with an
.B archtype=StreamArchive
record and ends with a
.B status=EOF
record.
.ne 10
.SH "HEADER FORMAT
.PP
The header records  use the following format:
.PP
.RS
\&"%d %s=%s\en",
.IR <length> ", " <keyword> ", " <value>
.RE
.PP
Each record starts with a a decimal length field. The length includes
the total size of a record including the length field itself and the trailing
new line.
.PP
The
.I keyword
may not include an equal sign.
All keywords beginning with upper case letters are reserved for
local extensions.
.PP
If the value field is of zero length, it deletes any header field of the same
name that is in effect from the same extended header or from a previous global
header.
.PP
Null characters do not delimit any value. The data used for
.I value 
is only limited by its
implicit length.
.SH "HEADER KEYWORDS
All numerical values are represented as decimal strings.
All texts are represented as 7-bit ascii or UTF-8:
.TP
.B atime
The time from
.B st_atime
in sub second granularity. 
A nanosecond granularity is currently supported.
.TP
.B comment
Any number of characters that  should be treated as comment.
The comment is ignored.
.TP
.B ctime
The time from
.B st_ctime
in sub second granularity. 
A nanosecond granularity is currently supported.
.TP
.B dev
The device id from
.B st_dev
of the file as decimal number.
.sp
The value is a signed int.
An implementation should be able to handle at least 64 bit values.
Note that the value is signed because POSIX does not specify
more than the type should be an int.
.TP
.B devmajor
The device major number of the file if it is a character or block special file.
The argument is a decimal number.
.sp
The value is a signed int.
An implementation should be able to handle at least 64 bit values.
Note that the value is signed because POSIX does not specify
more than the type should be an int.
.TP
.B devminor
The device minor number of the file if it is a character or block special file.
The argument is a decimal number.
.sp
The value is a signed int.
An implementation should be able to handle at least 64 bit values.
Note that the value is signed because POSIX does not specify
more than the type should be an int.
.TP
.B filetype
A textual version of the real file type of the file.
The following names are used:
.RS
.TP 24
.B unallocated
An unknown file type that may be a result of a
.BR unlink (2)
operation.
This should never happen.
.TP
.B regular
A regular file.
.TP
.B contiguous
A contiguous file. On operating systems or file systems that don't support
this file type, it is handled like a regular file.
.TP
.B symlink
A symbolic link to any file type.
.TP
.B directory
A directory.
.TP
.B "character special"
A character special file.
.TP
.B "block special"
A block special file.
.TP
.B fifo
A named pipe.
.TP
.B socket
A UNIX domain socket.
.TP
.B "mpx character special"
A multiplexed character special file.
.TP
.B "mpx block special"
A multiplexed block special file.
.TP
.B "XENIX nsem"
A XENIX named semaphore.
.TP
.B "XENIX nshd"
XENIX shared data.
.TP
.B door
A Solaris door.
.TP
.B eventcount
A UNOS event count.
.TP
.B whiteout
A BSD whiteout directory entry.
.TP
.B sparse
A sparse regular file.
.TP
.B volheader
A volume header.
.TP
.B "unknown/bad"
Any other unknown file type.
This should never happen.
.RE
.TP
.B arfiletype
The following additional file types are used in
.BR arfiletype :
.RS
.TP
.B hardlink
A hard link to any file type.
.RE

.TP
.B gid
The group ID of the group that owns the file.
The argument is a decimal number.
.TP
.B gname
The group name of the following file(s) coded in UTF-8.
.TP
.B ino
The inode number from
.B st_ino
of the file as decimal number.
.sp
The value is an unsigned int.
An implementation should be able to handle at least 64 bit unsigned values.
.TP
.B linkpath
The name of the 
.I linkpath
coded in UTF-8 if it is longer than 100 characters or cannot be expressed in 7-Bit ASCII.
.TP
.B mtime
The time from
.B st_mtime
in sub second granularity. 
A nanosecond granularity is currently supported.
.TP
.B nlink
The link count of the file as decimal number.
.sp
The value is an unsigned int.
An implementation should be able to handle at least 32 bit unsigned values.
.TP
.B path
The name of the 
.I path
coded in UTF-8.
.TP
.B size
The size of the file as decimal number.
The
.B size
keyword may not refer to the real file size but is related to the size if the file in the archive.
