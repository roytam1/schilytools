.SH NAME
streamarchive \- StreamArchive file format
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B StreamArchive
typed archives are a series of
.B keyword
and
.B value
records that are similar to content of the 
POSIX.1-2001 extended headers called
.BR "TAR (PAX) HEADERs" ,
based on a proposal from
.B Sun Microsystems
from 1997.
.LP
A new file always begins with the
.B path
keyword and after the mandatory
.B size
keyword, file content may follow.
Each file record is terminated by a
.B status
keyword.
.LP
An archive begins with an
.B archtype=StreamArchive
record and ends with a
.B status=EOF
record.
.LP
The archive meta data do not add non-printable characters.
If the file names in the archive are only made from ASCII characters and
if the archive only contains files with ASCII content, the whole archive
contains only ASCII content.

.SH "HEADER FORMAT
.PP
The header records  use the following format:
.PP
.RS
\&"%d %s=%s\en",
.IR <length> ", " <keyword> ", " <value>
.RE
.PP
Each record starts with a a decimal length field. The length includes
the total size of a record including the length field itself and the trailing
new line.
.PP
The
.I keyword
may not include an equal sign.
All keywords beginning with upper case letters are reserved for
local extensions.
.PP
If the value field is of zero length, it deletes any header field of the same
name that is in effect from the same extended header or from a previous global
header.
.PP
Null characters do not delimit any value. The data used for
.I value 
is only limited by its
implicit length.
.SH "HEADER KEYWORDS
All numerical values are represented as decimal strings.
All texts are represented as UTF-8 or an unspecified binary format (see
.B hdrcharset
keyword) that is expected to be understood by the receiving system:
.TP
.B atime
The time from
.B st_atime
in sub second granularity. 
A nanosecond granularity is currently supported.
