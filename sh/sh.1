.SH NAME
sh, jsh \- standard and job control shell and command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The \fB/usr/bin/sh\fR utility is a command programming language that
executes commands read from a terminal or a file.
.sp
.LP
The \fBjsh\fR utility is an interface to the shell that provides all of the
functionality of \fBsh\fR and enables job control (see \fBJob Control\fR
section below).
.sp
.LP
Arguments to the shell are listed in the \fBInvocation\fR section below.
.SS "Definitions"
.sp
.LP
A \fIblank\fR is a tab or a space. A \fIname\fR is a sequence of
\fBASCII\fR letters, digits, or underscores, beginning with a letter or an
underscore. A \fIparameter\fR is a name, a digit, or any of the characters
\fB*\fR, \fB@\fR, \fB#\fR, \fB?\fR, \fB\(mi\fR, \fB$\fR, and \fB!\fR.

.SS "Invocation"
.sp
.LP
If the shell is invoked through
.BR exec (2)
and the first character of
argument zero is
.BR \(mi ,
commands are initially read from
.B /etc/profile and from
.BR $HOME/.profile,
if such files exist.
Thereafter, commands are read as described below, which is also the case
when the shell is invoked as
.BR /usr/bin/sh .

.SH OPTIONS
The options below are
interpreted by the shell on invocation only.
.B Note:
Unless the
.B \-c
or
.B \-s
option is specified, the first argument is assumed to be the name
of a file containing commands, and the remaining arguments are passed as
positional parameters to that command file:
.br
.ne 2
.TP 12
.BI \-c " string"
If the
.B -c
option is present commands are read from
.IR string .
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B \-i
If the
.B \-i
option is present or if the shell input and output are
attached to a terminal, this shell is
.BR interactive .
In this case,
TERMINATE is ignored (so that
.B kill 0
does not kill an interactive
shell) and INTERRUPT is caught and ignored (so that \fBwait\fR is
interruptible). In all cases, QUIT is ignored by the shell.
.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B \-p
If the
.B \-p
option is present, the shell does not set the effective user
and group IDs to the real user and group IDs.
.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B \-r
If the
.B \-r
option is present the shell is a restricted shell (see
.BR rsh (1M)).
.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B \-s
If the
.B \-s
option is present or if no arguments remain, commands are
read from the standard input. Any remaining arguments specify the positional
parameters. Shell output (except for
.BR "Special Commands" )
is written to file descriptor 2.
.TP
.B \-version
Print the current
.B Bourne Shell
version and exit.
.LP
Using
.B +
rather than
.B \-
causes the related options to be turned off.
The remaining options and arguments are described under the
.B set
command below.

.SH USAGE
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
A \fIsimple-command\fR is a sequence of non-blank \fIword\fRs separated by
\fIblank\fRs. The first \fIword\fR specifies the name of the command to be
executed. Except as specified below, the remaining \fIword\fRs are passed as
arguments to the invoked command. The command name is passed as argument 0
(see \fBexec\fR(2)). The \fIvalue\fR of a \fIsimple-command\fR is its exit
status if it terminates normally, or (octal) \fB200\fR+\fIstatus\fR if it
terminates abnormally. See \fBsignal.h\fR(3HEAD) for a list of status
values.
.sp
.LP
A \fIpipeline\fR is a sequence of one or more \fIcommand\fRs separated by
\fB|\fR. The standard output of each \fIcommand\fR but the last is connected
by a \fBpipe\fR(2) to the standard input of the next \fIcommand\fR. Each
\fIcommand\fR is run as a separate process. The shell waits for the last
\fIcommand\fR to terminate. The exit status of a \fIpipeline\fR is the exit
status of the last command in the \fIpipeline\fR.
.sp
.LP
A \fIlist\fR is a sequence of one or more \fIpipeline\fRs separated by
\fB;\fR, \fB&\fR, \fB&&\fR, or \fB|\||\fR, and optionally terminated by
\fB;\fR or \fB&\fR\&. Of these four symbols, \fB;\fR and \fB&\fR have equal
precedence, which is lower than that of \fB&&\fR and \fB|\||\fR. The symbols
\fB&&\fR and \fB|\||\fR also have equal precedence. A semicolon (\fB;\fR)
causes sequential execution of the preceding \fIpipeline\fR, that is, the
shell waits for the \fIpipeline\fR to finish before executing any commands
following the semicolon. An ampersand (\fB&\fR) causes asynchronous
execution of the preceding pipeline, that is, the shell does \fBnot\fR wait
for that pipeline to finish. The symbol \fB&&\fR (\|\fB|\||\fR) causes the
\fIlist\fR following it to be executed only if the preceding pipeline
returns a zero (non-zero) exit status. An arbitrary number of newlines can
appear in a \fIlist\fR, instead of semicolons, to delimit commands.
.sp
.LP
A \fIcommand\fR is either a \fIsimple-command\fR or one of the following.
Unless otherwise stated, the value returned by a command is that of the last
\fIsimple-command\fR executed in the command.
.sp

\fBdone\fR\fR
.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
Each time a \fBfor\fR command is executed, \fIname\fR is set to the next
\fIword\fR taken from the \fBin\fR \fIword\fR list. If \fBin\fR \fIword\fR
\&.\|.\|. is omitted, then the \fBfor\fR command executes the \fBdo\fR
\fIlist\fR once for each positional parameter that is set (see \fBParameter
Substitution\fR section below). Execution ends when there are no more words
in the list.

.ad
.sp .6
.RS 4n
A \fBcase\fR command executes the \fIlist\fR associated with the first
\fIpattern\fR that matches \fIword\fR. The form of the patterns is the same
as that used for file-name generation (see \fBFile Name Generation\fR
section), except that a slash, a leading dot, or a dot immediately following
a slash need not be matched explicitly.

\fBfi\fR
.sp
.LP
The \fIlist\fR following \fBif\fR is executed and, if it returns a zero
exit status, the \fIlist\fR following the first \fBthen\fR is executed.
Otherwise, the \fIlist\fR following \fBelif\fR is executed and, if its value
is zero, the \fIlist\fR following the next \fBthen\fR is executed. Failing
that, the \fBelse\fR \fIlist\fR is executed. If no \fBelse\fR \fIlist\fR or
\fBthen\fR \fIlist\fR is executed, then the \fBif\fR command returns a zero
exit status.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fBwhile\fR \fIlist\fR \fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR \fBdone\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt
A \fBwhile\fR command repeatedly executes the \fBwhile\fR \fIlist\fR and,
if the exit status of the last command in the list is zero, executes the
\fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR; otherwise the loop terminates. If no commands in the
\fBdo\fR \fIlist\fR are executed, then the \fBwhile\fR command returns a
zero exit status; \fBuntil\fR can be used in place of \fBwhile\fR to negate
the loop termination test.
.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk

.RE

.sp
.ne 2

\fB\fB{\fR \fIlist\fR\fB;}\fR\fR

\fIlist\fR is executed in the current (that is, parent) shell. The \fB{\fR

.sp

.na
\fB\fIname\fR \fB(\|) {\fR \fIlist\fR\fB;}\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 27n
.rt
Define a function which is referenced by \fIname\fR. The body of the
function is the \fIlist\fR of commands between \fB{\fR and \fB}\fR. The
\fB{\fR must be followed by a space. Execution of functions is described
below (see \fBExecution\fR section). The \fB{\fR and \fB}\fR are unnecessary
if the body of the function is a \fIcommand\fR as defined above, under
\fBCommands\fR.
.RE

.sp
.LP
The following words are only recognized as the first word of a command and
when not quoted:
.sp
.LP
\fBif  then  else  elif  fi  case  esac  for  while  until  do  done  {
}\fR
.SS "Comments Lines"
.sp
.LP
A word beginning with \fB#\fR causes that word and all the following
characters up to a newline to be ignored.
.SS "Command Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The shell reads commands from the string between two grave accents
(\fB``\fR) and the standard output from these commands can be used as all or
part of a word. Trailing newlines from the standard output are removed.
.sp
.LP
No interpretation is done on the string before the string is read, except
to remove backslashes (\fB\e\fR) used to escape other characters.
Backslashes can be used to escape a grave accent (\fB`\fR) or another
backslash (\fB\e\fR) and are removed before the command string is read.
Escaping grave accents allows nested command substitution. If the command
substitution lies within a pair of double quotes (\fB" .\|.\|.\|` .\|.\|.\|`
\&.\|.\|.\| "\fR), a backslash used to escape a double quote (\fB\e"\fR) is
removed. Otherwise, it is left intact.
.sp
.LP
If a backslash is used to escape a newline character (\fB\enewline\fR),
both the backslash and the newline are removed (see the later section on
\fBQuoting\fR). In addition, backslashes used to escape dollar signs
(\fB\e$\fR) are removed. Since no parameter substitution is done on the
command string before it is read, inserting a backslash to escape a dollar
sign has no effect. Backslashes that precede characters other than \fB\e\fR,
\fB`\fR, \fB"\fR, \fBnewline\fR, and \fB$\fR are left intact when the
command string is read.
.SS "Parameter Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The character \fB$\fR is used to introduce substitutable \fIparameter\fRs.
There are two types of parameters, positional and keyword. If
\fIparameter\fR is a digit, it is a positional parameter. Positional
parameters can be assigned values by \fBset\fR. Keyword parameters (also
known as variables) can be assigned values by writing:
.sp
.LP
\fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR [ \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR ] .\|.\|.
.sp
.LP
The evaluation of the assignments is done from the left to the right in this shell.
.LP
Pattern-matching is not performed on \fIvalue\fR. There cannot be a
function and a variable with the same \fIname\fR.
.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB${\fR\fIparameter\fR\fB}\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 25n
.rt
The value, if any, of the parameter is substituted. The braces are required
only when \fIparameter\fR is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore that
is not to be interpreted as part of its name. If \fIparameter\fR is \fB*\fR
or \fB@\fR, all the positional parameters, starting with \fB$1\fR, are
substituted (separated by spaces). Parameter \fB$0\fR is set from argument
zero when the shell is invoked.

In the above, \fIword\fR is not evaluated unless it is to be used as the
substituted string, so that, in the following example, \fBpwd\fR is executed
only if \fBd\fR is not set or is null:

If any of the above is preceded by a digit, the file descriptor which is
associated with the file is that specified by the digit (instead of the

.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB\&... 2>&1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
associates file descriptor 2 with the file currently associated with file
descriptor 1.
.sp
.LP
The order in which redirections are specified is significant. The shell
evaluates redirections left-to-right. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB\&... 1>\fIxxx\fR 2>&1\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
first associates file descriptor 1 with file \fIxxx\fR. It associates file
descriptor 2 with the file associated with file descriptor 1 (that is,
\fIxxx\fR). If the order of redirections were reversed, file descriptor 2
would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been)
and file descriptor 1 would be associated with file \fIxxx\fR.
.sp
.LP
Using the terminology introduced on the first page, under \fBCommands\fR,
if a \fIcommand\fR is composed of several \fIsimple commands\fR, redirection
is evaluated for the entire \fIcommand\fR before it is evaluated for each
\fIsimple command\fR. That is, the shell evaluates redirection for the
entire \fIlist\fR, then each \fIpipeline\fR within the \fIlist\fR, then each
\fIcommand\fR within each \fIpipeline\fR, then each \fIlist\fR within each
\fIcommand\fR.

If a command is followed by \fB&\fR, the default standard input for the

.SS "File Name Generation"
.sp
.LP
Before a command is executed, each command \fIword\fR is scanned for the
characters \fB*\fR, \fB?\fR, and \fB[\fR. If one of these characters appears
the word is regarded as a \fIpattern\fR. The word is replaced with
alphabetically sorted file names that match the pattern. If no file name is
found that matches the pattern, the word is left unchanged. The character
\fB\&.\fR at the start of a file name or immediately following a \fB/\fR, as
well as the character \fB/\fR itself, must be matched explicitly.

.RE

.sp
.LP
Notice that all quoted characters (see below) must be matched explicitly in

.SS "Quoting"
.sp
.LP
The following characters have a special meaning to the shell and cause
termination of a word unless quoted:
.sp
.LP
\fB;  &  (  )  |  ^  <  >  newline  space  tab\fR
.sp
.LP
A character can be \fIquoted\fR (that is, made to stand for itself) by
preceding it with a backslash (\fB\e\fR) or inserting it between a pair of
quote marks (\fB\|'\|'\fR or \fB""\fR). During processing, the shell can
quote certain characters to prevent them from taking on a special meaning.
Backslashes used to quote a single character are removed from the word
before the command is executed. The pair \fB\enewline\fR is removed from a
word before command and parameter substitution.
.sp
.LP
All characters enclosed between a pair of single quote marks
(\fB\|'\|'\fR), except a single quote, are quoted by the shell. Backslash
has no special meaning inside a pair of single quotes. A single quote can be
quoted inside a pair of double quote marks (for example, \fB"\|'"\fR), but a
single quote can not be quoted inside a pair of single quotes.
.sp
.LP
Inside a pair of double quote marks (\fB""\fR), parameter and command
substitution occurs and the shell quotes the results to avoid blank
interpretation and file name generation. If \fB$*\fR is within a pair of
double quotes, the positional parameters are substituted and quoted,
separated by quoted spaces (\fB"$1 \|$2\fR \|.\|.\|.\fB"\fR). However, if
\fB$@\fR is within a pair of double quotes, the positional parameters are
substituted and quoted, separated by unquoted spaces (\fB"$1"\|"$2"\fR \|
\&.\|.\|. ). \fB\e\fR quotes the characters \fB\e\fR, \fB`\fR, \fB,\fR
(comma), and \fB$\fR. The pair \fB\enewline\fR is removed before parameter
and command substitution. If a backslash precedes characters other than
\fB\e\fR, \fB`\fR, \fB,\fR (comma), \fB$\fR, and newline, then the backslash
itself is quoted by the shell.
.SS "Prompting"
.sp
.LP
When used interactively, the shell prompts with the value of \fBPS1\fR
before reading a command. If at any time a newline is typed and further
input is needed to complete a command, the secondary prompt (that is, the
value of \fBPS2\fR) is issued.
.SS "Environment"
.sp
.LP
The \fIenvironment\fR (see \fBenviron\fR(5)) is a list of name-value pairs
that is passed to an executed program in the same way as a normal argument
list. The shell interacts with the environment in several ways. On
invocation, the shell scans the environment and creates a parameter for each
name found, giving it the corresponding value. If the user modifies the
value of any of these parameters or creates new parameters, none of these
affects the environment unless the \fBexport\fR command is used to bind the
shell's parameter to the environment (see also \fBset\fR \fB-a\fR). A
parameter can be removed from the environment with the \fBunset\fR command.
The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed of any
unmodified name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell, minus any
pairs removed by \fBunset\fR, plus any modifications or additions, all of
which must be noted in \fBexport\fR commands.
.sp
.LP
The environment for any \fIsimple-command\fR can be augmented by prefixing
it with one or more assignments to parameters. Thus:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBTERM=450  \fIcommand\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fB(export TERM; TERM=450;   \fIcommand\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
are equivalent as far as the execution of \fIcommand\fR is concerned if
\fIcommand\fR is not a Special Command. If \fIcommand\fR is a Special
Command, then
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBTERM=450   \fIcommand\fR\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
modifies the \fBTERM\fR variable in the current shell.
.sp
.LP
If the \fB-k\fR flag is set, \fIall\fR keyword arguments are placed in the
environment, even if they occur after the command name. The following
example first prints \fBa=b c\fR and \fBc\fR:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBecho a=b  c

a=b  c

set  \(mik

echo a=b  c

c\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Signals"
.sp
.LP
The \fBINTERRUPT\fR and \fBQUIT\fR signals for an invoked command are
ignored if the command is followed by \fB&\fR\&. Otherwise, signals have the
values inherited by the shell from its parent, with the exception of signal
11 (but see also the \fBtrap\fR command below).
.SS "Execution"
.sp
.LP
Each time a command is executed, the command substitution, parameter
substitution, blank interpretation, input/output redirection, and filename
generation listed above are carried out. If the command name matches the
name of a defined function, the function is executed in the shell process
(note how this differs from the execution of shell script files, which
require a sub-shell for invocation). If the command name does not match the
name of a defined function, but matches one of the \fBSpecial Commands\fR
listed below, it is executed in the shell process.
.sp
.LP
The positional parameters \fB$1\fR, \fB$2\fR, .\|.\|. are set to the
arguments of the function. If the command name matches neither a \fBSpecial
Command\fR nor the name of a defined function, a new process is created and
an attempt is made to execute the command via \fBexec\fR(2).
.sp
.LP
The shell parameter \fBPATH\fR defines the search path for the directory
containing the command. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon
(\fB:\fR). The default path is
.BR /usr/bin: .
The current directory is
specified by a null path name, which can appear immediately after the equal
sign, between two colon delimiters anywhere in the path list, or at the end
of the path list. If the command name contains a \fB/\fR the search path is
not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for an
executable file. If the file has execute permission but is not an
\fBa.out\fR file, it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands. A
sub-shell is spawned to read it. A parenthesized command is also executed in
a sub-shell.
.sp
.LP
The location in the search path where a command was found is remembered by
the shell (to help avoid unnecessary \fIexec\fRs later). If the command was
found in a relative directory, its location must be re-determined whenever
the current directory changes. The shell forgets all remembered locations
whenever the \fBPATH\fR variable is changed or the \fBhash\fR \fB-r\fR
command is executed (see below).
.SS "Special Commands"
.sp
.LP
Input/output redirection is now permitted for these commands. File
descriptor 1 is the default output location. When Job Control is enabled,

.B ESC- ^N
Search forwards in the history.
The user is prompted for a search pattern.
The previous search string is kept and may be edited.
To enter a new search string, first type
.BR ^U .
.TP
.B ESC- CR
Return to the history line that was in use before the last search command.
.LP
Other characters are inserted into the command line text.
Characters that are listed above as being edit command characters need to be
quoted using the quote character
.BR ^^ .
If a line is entered via
.B CR
or
.BR NL ,
the current position of the cursor is irrelevant.
.LP
The command line editor remembers the cursor position for each command line
in the history during the lifetime of the shell process.
.SS "History Editing Input Mappings"
.LP
The command line editor reads the file
.B $HOME/.bshmap
at startup to retrieve additional mappings.

.SS "Large File Behavior"
.LP
The
.B Bourne Shell
is large file aware.
See \fBlargefile\fR(5) for an extended description of the behavior of \fBsh\fR and
\fBjsh\fR when encountering files greater than or equal to 2 Gbyte ( 2^31
bytes).
.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
Errors detected by the shell, such as syntax errors, cause the shell to
return a non-zero exit status. If the shell is being used non-interactively
execution of the shell file is abandoned. Otherwise, the shell returns the
exit status of the last command executed (see also the \fBexit\fR command
above).
.SS "jsh Only"
.sp
.LP
If the shell is invoked as \fBjsh\fR and an attempt is made to exit the
shell while there are stopped jobs, the shell issues one warning:
.sp
.LP
\fBThere are stopped jobs.\fR
.sp
.LP
This is the only message. If another exit attempt is made, and there are
still stopped jobs they are sent a \fBSIGHUP\fR signal from the kernel and
the shell is exited.

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The use of \fBsetuid\fR shell scripts is \fBstrongly\fR discouraged.
.SH NOTES
.LP
For compatibility with the
.BR "Thompson shell" ,
.B ^
is a synonym for
.B |
as pipeline separator.
Do not use in new scripts.
.LP
Words used for filenames in input/output redirection are not interpreted
for filename generation (see \fBFile Name Generation\fR section above). For
example, \fBcat file1 >a*\fR createsa file named \fBa*\fR.
.sp
.LP
Because commands in pipelines are run as separate processes, variables set
in a pipeline have no effect on the parent shell.
.sp
.LP
If the input or the output of a \fBwhile\fR or \fBuntil\fR loop is
redirected, the commands in the loop are run in a sub-shell, and variables
set or changed there have no effect on the parent process:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   lastline=
   while read line
   do

           lastline=$line
   done < /etc/passwd
   echo "lastline=$lastline"       # lastline is empty!
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In these cases, the input or output can be redirected by using \fBexec\fR,
as in the following example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   # Save standard input (file descriptor 0) as file
   # descriptor 3, and redirect standard input from the file
   /etc/passwd:

   exec 3<&0               # save standard input as fd 3
   exec </etc/passwd       # redirect input from file

   lastline=
   while read line
   do
           lastline=$line
   done

   exec 0<&3               # restore standard input
   exec 3<&-               # close file descriptor 3
   echo "$lastline"        # lastline
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If you get the error message, "\fBcannot fork, too many processes\fR", try
using the \fBwait\fR(1) command to clean up your background processes. If
this doesn't help, the system process table is probably full or you have too
many active foreground processes. There is a limit to the number of process
ids associated with your login, and to the number the system can keep track
of.
.sp
.LP
Only the last process in a pipeline can be waited for.
.sp
.LP
If a command is executed, and a command with the same name is installed in
a directory in the search path before the directory where the original
command was found, the shell continues to \fBexec\fR the original command.
Use the \fBhash\fR command to correct this situation.
.sp
.LP
The Bourne shell has a limitation on the effective \fBUID\fR for a process.
If this \fBUID\fR is less than 100 (and not equal to the real UID of the
process), then the \fBUID\fR is reset to the real UID of the process.
.sp
.LP
If not in 
.B job control
mode, the shell implements both foreground and background jobs in the same
process group and they all receive the same signals, which can
lead to unexpected behavior. It is, therefore, recommended to switch on
.B job control
mode via
.B set \-m
in an interactive environment.
.LP
There is only one namespace for both functions and parameters.
A function definition will delete a parameter with the same name and vice-versa.
.LP
Parameter assignments that precede a special command affect the shell itself. 
Parameter assignments that precede the call of a function are ignored.
.LP
When the shell executes a shell script that attempts to execute a
non-existent command interpreter, the shell returns an erroneous diagnostic
message that the shell script file does not exist.
