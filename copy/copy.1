.SH NAME
copy \- makes copies of file(s)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
copy \-i
[
.I options
]
.PP
copy with prompt for filenames
.PP
.B
copy
[
.I options
]
.B from_file to_file
.PP
copy a single file
.PP
.B
copy
[
.I options
]
.B from1\|.\|.\|.fromn targetdir
.PP
copy multiple files into one directory that must exist
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Copy
makes a copy of the first file and gives it the second
filename. If the first file does not exist or cannot be opened
or if the second file cannot be created or opened,
.B copy
prints an error message. If the second file already exists, it is
overwritten.
.PP
Copying directories, devices, fifos and the like are
permitted, but are treated differently. Copying a directory
just creates the target directory. Copying a device just
creates a new device node. Copying a fifo just
creates a new fifo.
.PP
To copy multiple source files to a target directory: list the
source files on the command line followed by the name of the
target directory.
.B Copy
verifies that the last named file is
indeed a directory before attempting the copy or reporting an
error.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-force\-hole
Try to enforce the target filee to be a sparse file. To achive this,
.B copy
reads the file in 512 Byte blocks. If a block only contains null bytes,
no data is written to the target file. This option works if the filesystem
for the target file allows to create sparse files, regardless of the state
of the source file.
.TP
.B \-i
Interactive.
If file type arguments are present,
.B copy
will prompt for confirmation whenever the copy would overwrite an existing
.IR target .
A "\fBy\fP"
answer means that the copy should proceed.
Any other answer prevents
.B copy
from overwriting
.IR target .
If no file type arguments are present,
.B copy
will prompt: 
.B "From: To: 
until either a ^C, ^D, or an empty line is typed.
.TP
.B \-q
Query.
Requests confirmation before each file; "\fBy\fP" or "\fByes\fP"
to do the copy, anything else to skip the file.
.TP
.B \-R
POSIX recursive.
If the from file is a directory,
.B copy
creates not only
the target directory but recursively copies all
subfiles. If the
.I "target directory
exists, a directory type 
.I from
parameter always results in a concatenation
of the last path name component of the
.I from 
parameter and the
.I "target directory
name.
.sp
If the 
.I "target directory 
does not exist in POSIX recursive copy mode
and there are only two directory type parameters, the 
.I "target directory
is created and the content of the 
.I "from directory
is copied to the 
.IR "target directory" .
This is different from the case when the
.I "target directory 
exists.
.TP
.B \-r
Recursive.
Same as
.B \-R
but if there are only two directory type path parameters, the content of the
.I from
directory
will be copied into 
.I target
directory.
.TP
.B \-setowner
Setowner.
Attempts to copy the original user id
(only the system administrator can do this).
.TP
.B \-setgrp
Setgroup.
Attempts to copy the original group id
(only the system administrator can do this).
.TP
.B \-s
Attempts to copy both, the owner- ant the group-id of the files
(only the system administrator can do this).
.TP
.BR \-olddate , " \-o"
Olddate
Attempts to copy the original date and time.
.TP
.B \-p
Attempt to preserve file permissions, file owner id, file group id and
file times.
If 
.B copy
fails to set the owner id or group id on the new file, the permissions
S_ISUID and S_ISGID are cleared.
.TP
.B \-sparse
Attempt to preserve holes in sparse regular files.
On platforms that support SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE
.BR lseek (2)
whence values,
.B copy
is able to effeciently and correctly restore all hole positions.
.TP
.B \-v
Verbose
Reports the result of the copy.
.SH NOTES
If the 
.I "target file
does not exist,
.B copy
attempts to retain the original user access modes even if 
.B \-p
has not been specified. Copying
a device file results in only copying the device file entry, not
in reading the device.
.PP
When copying an entire directory (using the
.B \-r
option), the target directory should not exist. Otherwise, a subdirectory
with the same name as the source directory is created and used
as the destination for all the files.
.PP
No slash will be accepted in the interactive mode if the
environment variable 'SLASH=off' is set.
