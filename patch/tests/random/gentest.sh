# A random file test with 1..10 generations of patches in a single patch file.
# A file is generated, then modified 1..10 times and every time a diff is
# created and concatenated to a single patch file. Then the original file
# is patched and compared to the expected result.
#
# The diff type is random, this allows to check the quality of the automated
# diff type recognition.
