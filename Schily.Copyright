* cdrecord -- Record data on a CD/DVD/Blu-Ray-Recorder
  Copyright (c) 1995-2019 J. Schilling
  License: CDDL

When using the original name "cdrecord" or a similar name:

-       You may not modify certain copyright messages in cdrecord.c
        See cdrecord.c for further information.
	This is a requirement from "Urheberrecht" and not a license
	issue.

-       You may (with a few exceptions) not modify the location of the
        configuration file /etc/default/cdrecord.
        See defaults.c for further information.

The file cdrecord/LICENSE gives the Details of the further
restrictions to the CDDL for the program cdrecord. The limitations have
been negotiated with Debian in 2001. They are intended to grant users a
uniform command line interface on all platforms when using a program
with the name "cdrecord". This restricted does not stand for the case
you change the name of the program. This clause is similar to the TeX
clause.

                third party under the terms of this License.

            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is
                granted: (1) for code that You delete from the Original
                Software, or (2) for infringements caused by: (i) the
                modification of the Original Software, or (ii) the
                combination of the Original Software with other software
                or devices.

            (c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) are

                otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third
                party.

            (d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent license is

                Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
                Modifications made by that Contributor.

    3. Distribution Obligations.

        3.1. Availability of Source Code.

        Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
        available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
        Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
        the terms of this License.  You must include a copy of this
        License with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered
        Software You distribute or otherwise make available.  You must
        inform recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form
        as to how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
        form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
        used for software exchange.

        3.2. Modifications.

        The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are
        governed by the terms of this License.  You represent that You
        believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
        You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
        License.

        3.3. Required Notices.

        You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
        identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification.  You may
        not remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
        contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
        or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
        the Initial Developer.

        3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

        You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
        Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
        of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder.  You may
        choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
        Covered Software.  However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
        and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
        You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
        indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
        hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
        Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
        such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
        liability terms You offer.

        3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

        You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
        under the terms of this License or under the terms of a license of
        Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
        provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
        and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
        limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
        the rights set forth in this License.  If You distribute the
        Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
        must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
        this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial
        Developer or Contributor.  You hereby agree to indemnify the
        Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
        by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
        such terms You offer.

        3.6. Larger Works.

        You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Software with
        other code not governed by the terms of this License and
        distribute the Larger Work as a single product.  In such a case,
        You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
        for the Covered Software.

    4. Versions of the License.

        4.1. New Versions.

        Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
        publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
        time.  Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
        Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
        steward has the right to modify this License.

        4.2. Effect of New Versions.

        You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
        Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
        License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
        If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
        Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
        available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
        distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
        of the version of the License under which You originally received
        the Covered Software.  Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
        distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
        the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
        the license steward.

        4.3. Modified Versions.

        When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
        license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
        modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
        and remove any references to the name of the license steward
        (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
        (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
        differ from this License.

    5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

        COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS"
        BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
        INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED
        SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
        PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
        PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD ANY
        COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
        NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  THIS DISCLAIMER OF
        WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE.  NO USE OF
        ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS
        DISCLAIMER.

    6. TERMINATION.

        6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
        automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
        cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
        Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
        the termination of this License shall survive.

        6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
        declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
        Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
        assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") alleging that
        the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
        the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
        the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
        infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
        indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
        the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
        under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
        notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
        at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
        such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
        Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
        or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

        6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
        all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
        distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
        granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

    7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

        UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
        (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
        INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
        COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE
        LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
        LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK
        STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
        COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
        INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  THIS LIMITATION OF
        LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL
        INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT
        APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO
        NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
        CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT
        APPLY TO YOU.

    8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

        The Covered Software is a "commercial item," as that term is
        defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial
        computer software" (as that term is defined at 48
        C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software
        documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
        (Sept. 1995).  Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
        C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
        U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with only those
        rights set forth herein.  This U.S. Government Rights clause is in
        lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or
        provision that addresses Government rights in computer software
        under this License.

    9. MISCELLANEOUS.

        This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
        matter hereof.  If any provision of this License is held to be
        unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
        necessary to make it enforceable.  This License shall be governed
        by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law,
        if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's
        conflict-of-law provisions.  Any litigation relating to this
        License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts located
        in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
        within the Original Software, with the losing party responsible
        for costs, including, without limitation, court costs and
        reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  The application of the
        United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale
        of Goods is expressly excluded.  Any law or regulation which
        provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
        against the drafter shall not apply to this License.  You agree
        that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
        States export administration regulations (and the export control
        laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use,
        distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

    10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

        As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
        responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
        indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License
        and You agree to work with Initial Developer and Contributors to
        distribute such responsibility on an equitable basis.  Nothing
        herein is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission
        of liability.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------
