To install makefiles, just take the tar archive makefiles.tar
and untar it on the source root of your new project.

The tar file contains:

-	the RULES directory with the main make rules
-	two different DEFAULT directories with predefined project settings
-	a directory containing templates for all purpose
-	a skeleton directory structure for the new project
-	some README files that will be useful for developers and users

If you want to see a better example, please have a look at the "star"
source. It may be found on:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/s-tar/files/


Have a look at the manual page, it is included in the distribution.
Install the manual page with 

make install first and include /opt/schily/share/man in your MANPATH
