.SH NAME
cal \- display a calendar
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fBcal\fR [ [\fImonth\fR] \fIyear\fR]
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B cal
utility writes a Julian or Gregorian calendar to standard output. If
the
.I year
operand is specified, a calendar for that year is written. If
no operands are specified, a calendar for the current month is written.
.LP
The date to switch from the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar is
controlled by the environment variable
.B GREGORIAN
and the current locale.

.SH OPERANDS
.sp
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.sp
.ne 2
.TP 10
.I month
Specify the month to be displayed, represented as a decimal integer from
.B 1
(January) to
.B 12
(December). The default is the current
month.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.I year
Specify the year for which the calendar is displayed, represented as a
decimal integer from
.B 1
to
.BR 9999 .
The default is the current
year.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See
.BR environ (5)
for descriptions of the following environment
variables that affect the execution of
.BR cal :
.BR LANG ,
.BR LC_ALL ,
.BR LC_CTYPE ,
.BR LC_TIME ,
.BR LC_MESSAGES ,
and
.BR NLSPATH .
.sp
.ne 2
.TP 10
.B TZ
Determine the timezone used to calculate the value of the current month.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B GREGORIAN
Unless
.B LC_ALL
or
.B LC_TIME
have been set to
.BR C ,
the environment
.B GREGORIAN
allows to specify a switch date to change from the Julian calendar to the
Gregorian calendar. The argument must be in the form:
.sp
.in +5
.IB yyyy / mm / dd
.in -5
.sp
or
.sp
.in +5
.IB yyyy - mm - dd
.in -5
.sp
and holds the day of the switch based on the Julian calendar.
For the catholic parts of the Holy Roman Empire, this would be
.B 1582/10/05
as October 5th was replaced by October 15th in 1582.
For Prussia (Berlin), this would be
.B 1612/08/23
as August 23th was replaced by September 2th in 1612.
.sp
If
.B GREGORIAN
was not set or when in the
.B C
locale, the switch to the Gregorian calendar appears as if
.B GREGORIAN
was set to
.BR 1752/9/3 .
This is to make
.BR cal (1)
compatible to the historic UNIX definition.
.sp
A leading
.B +
sign in
.B GREGORIAN
allows to enforce the switch date even when in the
.B C 
locale.

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.TP 10
.B 0
Successful completion.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B >0
An error occurred.

.SH NOTES
.sp
.LP
In case that the environment
.B GREGORIAN
is not active,
an unusual calendar is printed for September 1752. That is the month 11
days were skipped in the Kingdom of Great Britain and their colonies
to make up for lack of leap year adjustments. To see this
calendar, type:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
cal 9 1752
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
The command
.B "cal 83"
refers to the year 83, not 1983.
.sp
.LP
The year is always considered to start in January.
