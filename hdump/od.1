.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B od
command copies sequentially each input file to standard output and
transforms the input data according to the output types specified by the
.B -t
or
.B -bcCDdFfOoSsvXx
options. If no output type is specified, the
default output is as if
.B "-t o2"
had been specified.  Multiple types
can be specified by using multiple
.B -bcCDdFfOoSstvXx
options. Output lines
are written for each type specified in the order in which the types are
specified. If no
.I file
is specified, the standard input is used.  The
.RI [ offset_string ]
operand is mutually exclusive from the
.BR -A ,
.BR -j ,
.BR -N ,
and
.B -t
options. For the purposes of this description, the
following terms are used:
.br
.ne 2
.TP 18n
.B word
Refers to a 16-bit unit, independent of the word size of the machine.

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B long word
Refers to a 32-bit unit.

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B double long word
Refers to a 64-bit unit.

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.LP
The following options are supported:
.br
.ne 2
.TP 17n
.BI -A " address_base
Specifies the input offset base. The
.I address_base
option-argument must be
a character.  The characters
.BR d ,
.B o
and
.B x
specify that the
offset base will be written in decimal, octal or hexadecimal, respectively. The
character
.B n
specifies that the offset will not be written. Unless
.B -A
.B n
is specified, the output line will be preceded by the input offset,
cumulative across input files, of the next byte to be written. In addition, the
offset of the byte following the last byte written will be displayed after all
the input data has been processed. Without the
.B -A
.I address_base
option and the
.RI [ offset_string ]
operand, the input offset base is displayed
in octal.

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B -b
Interprets bytes in octal.  This is equivalent to
.BR "-t o1" .

.SS "/usr/bin/od"
.sp
.ne 2
.TP 17n
.B -c
Displays single-byte characters. Certain non-graphic characters appear as
C-language escapes:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
null	        \fB\e0\fR
backspace	   \fB\eb\fR
form-feed	   \fB\ef\fR
new-line	   \fB\en\fR
return	   \fB\er\fR
tab	        \fB\et\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Others appear as 3-digit octal numbers. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBecho "hello world" | od \(mic\fR
0000000   h   e   l   l   o       w   o   r   l   d  \en
0000014
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/od"
.sp
.ne 2
.TP 18n
.B -c
Interprets bytes as single-byte or multibyte characters according to the
current setting of the
.B LC_CTYPE
locale category. Printable multibyte
characters are written in the area corresponding to the first byte of the
character. The two-character sequence
.B **
is written in the area
corresponding to each remaining byte in the character, as an indication that
the
character is continued. Non-graphic characters appear the same as they would
using the
.B -C
option.

.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B -C
Interprets bytes as single-byte or multibyte characters according to the
current setting of the
.B LC_CTYPE
locale category. Printable multibyte
characters are written in the area corresponding to the first byte of the
character. The two-character sequence ** is written in the area corresponding
to
each remaining byte in the character, as an indication that the character is
continued. Certain non-graphic characters appear as C escapes:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
null	        \fB\e0\fR
backspace	   \fB\eb\fR
form-feed	   \fB\ef\fR
new-line	   \fB\en\fR
return	   \fB\er\fR
tab	        \fB\et\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

Other non-printable characters appear as one three-digit octal number for each
byte in the character.

.BR f4 .

.br
.ne 2

Interprets double long words in extended precision. This is equivalent to
.BR "-t f8" .

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.BI -j " skip
Jumps over
.I skip
bytes from the beginning of the input. The
.B od
command will read or seek past the first
.I skip
bytes in the concatenated
input files.  If the combined input is not at least
.I skip
bytes long, the
.B od
command will write a diagnostic message to standard error and exit with
a non-zero exit status.
.sp
By default, the
.I skip
option-argument is interpreted as a decimal number.
With a leading
.B 0x
or
.BR 0X ,
the offset is interpreted as a hexadecimal
number; otherwise, with a leading
.BR 0 ,
the offset will be interpreted as an
octal number.  Appending the character
.BR b ,
.BR k ,
or
.B m
to offset
will cause it to be interpreted as a multiple of
.BR 512 ,
.B 1024
or
\fB1\|048\|576\fR bytes, respectively. If the
.I skip
number is hexadecimal,
any appended
.B b
is considered to be the final hexadecimal digit. The
address is displayed starting at
.BR 0000000 ,
and its base is not implied by
the base of the
.I skip
option-argument.

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.BI -N " count
Formats no more than
.I count
bytes of input. By default,
.I count
is
interpreted as a decimal number.  With a leading
.B 0x
or
.BR 0X ,
.I count
is interpreted as a hexadecimal number; otherwise, with a leading
.BR 0 ,
it is interpreted as an octal number. If
.I count
bytes of input
(after successfully skipping, if
.BI -j skip
is specified) are not
available, it will not be considered an error. The
.B od
command will format
the input that is available.  The base of the address displayed is not implied
by the base of the
.I count
option-argument.

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B -o
Interprets words in octal. This is equivalent to
.BR "-t o2" .

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B -O
.RB "Interprets long words in unsigned octal.  This is equivalent to" " -t"
.BR o4 .

.br
.ne 2

.B -s
Interprets words in signed decimal. This is equivalent to
.BR "-t d2" .

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.B -S
Interprets long words in signed decimal. This is equivalent to
.B -t
.BR d4 .

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.BI -t " type_string
Specifies one or more output types. The
.I type_string
option-argument must
be a string specifying the types to be used when writing the input data. The
string must consist of the type specification characters:
.sp
.ne 2
.RS
.TP
.B a
.IR "Named character" .
Interprets bytes as named characters. Only the least
significant seven bits of each byte will be used for this type specification.

corresponding names for those characters.

Printable multibyte characters are written in the area corresponding to the
first byte of the character. The two-character sequence
.B **
is written in
the area corresponding to each remaining byte in the character, as an
indication
that the character is continued. Certain non-graphic characters appear as C
escapes: \fB\e0\fR, \fB\ea\fR, \fB\eb\fR, \fB\ef\fR, \fB\en\fR, \fB\er\fR,
\fB\et\fR, \fB\ev\fR\&. Other non-printable characters appear as one

The
.I offset_string
operand specifies the byte offset in the file where
dumping is to commence.  The offset is interpreted in octal bytes by default.
If
\fIoffset\fR begins with "\fB0\fR", it is interpreted in octal. If \fIoffset\fR
begins with "\fBx\fR" or "\fB0x\fR", it is interpreted in hexadecimal and any
appended "\fBb\fR" is considered to be the final hexadecimal digit. If "." is
appended, the offset is interpreted in decimal. If "\fBb\fR" or "\fBB\fR" is
appended, the offset is interpreted in units of
.B 512
bytes. If the
.B file
argument is omitted, the
.I offset
argument must be preceded by a
plus sign
.RB ( + ).
The address is displayed starting at the given offset.
The radix of the address will be the same as the radix of the offset, if
specified, otherwise it will be octal.  Decimal overrides octal, and it is an
error to specify both hexadecimal and decimal conversions in the same offset
operand.

This

in 1986 by J\*org Schilling.
In 2010, it has been enhanced by J\*org Schilling to include support
for the features of the AT&T and POSIX versions of
.B od
in order to replace the formerly closed source
.B od
implementation from OpenSolaris.
