		This is the test suite for the Schily Bourne Shell
		in compatibility mode for the OpenSolaris AT&T Bourne Shell

The directory "common" contains the linkage to the test suite, that calls the
test framework in "$SRCROOT/tests", the directory "shelltests" contains the
shell test suite itself.

To run the tests, simply call "make" to test the just compiled Schily Bourne
Shell at "$SRCROOT/sh/OBJ/<arch-dir>/sh". If a single test fails and is not
expected to fail, all further tests are stopped.

Failed tests leave debugging files in the subdirectory where the test did
take place, e.g. "$SRCROOT/sh/tests/shelltests/exit". If the output of the
test suite contains the word "FAIL", an unexpected failure was seen. If the
output of the test suite contains the word "XFAIL", an expected failure was
seen.

To run all tests even in case of a single unexpected failure, call
"EXPECT_FAIL=true make".

To run the tests with other shells, you need to specify the absolute path
to the shell in question. Call e.g.: "shell=/usr/bin/ksh93 make" or
"EXPECT_FAIL=true shell=/usr/bin/ksh93 make".
