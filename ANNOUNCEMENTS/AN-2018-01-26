New features with AN-2018-01-26:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	Schily Makefile System: The configuration for the Schily SunPro Make
	program now includes "DMAKE_OUTPUT_MODE=TXT2" to disable to print
	job headers for parallel make jobs. If you like to see these headers,
	call:

		dmake DMAKE_OUTPUT_MODE=TXT1

-	Schily Makefile System: Speed up the compilation with the
	Schily SunPro Make program by avoiding the need to call "uname" and
	similar in every sub-make program in order to fill in several
	architecture specific macros. This is done by exporting them into the
	environment via the make file directive "export". It allows to use the
	values in sub-makes without again being forced to call external
	programs.

-	Schily Makefile System: The locale settings are now automatically set
	to "C" for the Schily SunPro Make program. This was previously only
	supported and done for smake and gmake.

	It helps to avoid "strange behavior" of some of the support programs
	used by the schily makefile system.

-	README.compile now mentions how to use Schily SunPro Make and how to
	do parallel makes using "gmake" or "SunPro Make". Call e.g.:

		dmake -f SMakefile -j8

	to compile the whole set of schilytools (from the project root
	directory) in prarallel mode with a useful cuncurrency for a 4-CPU
	computer. Note that "-f SMakefile" is only in the top level directory
	level.

	Warning: SunPro Make (dmake) cannot be used with the schily makefile
	system on HP-UX-10.x. This is a result of a bug in "sed" that
	incorrectly handles:

		sed 'y%ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ, /\\()"%abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz,------%'

	on HP-UX-10.x, the '\\' is treated incorrectly as _two_ backslashes
	and the defective "sed" believes that the length of the from string
	and the length of the to string are not identical.

-	libschily: A fallback implementation for putenv() and unsetenv() has
	been included (taken from the smake program). unsetenv() is definitely
	needed on HP-UX-10.x, where it is missing from libc.

-	libschily: The snprintf() fallback implementation now uses void * as
	the second argument to format(). This has been forgotten when format()
	was modified to suport compilation on Win-DOS using "cl.exe" in
	August 2017.

-	mkisofs: The UDF filename encoding translation did not work correctly
	with japanese or chinese characters. Characters that did need more than
	2 octets in the UTF-8 source encoding have not been converted correctly
	into the UDF destination encoding and chinese characters occupy
	3 octets in the UTF-8 encoding.

	Mkisofs now correctly computes the length of the string with the source
	encoding instead of assuming max. 2 bytes for a UTF-8 encoding.

-	SunPro Make: Some .PHONY targets did not trigger an uncontitional
	rebuild of the target in some cases. This was fixed.

-	SunPro Make: The message: The "... is up to date" message is no longer
	printed in case that the related target is a .PHONY target.

-	SunPro Make: The text "dmake: defaulting to parallel mode.\n" is now only
	printed by the top level make program and no longer printed by nested
	calls to dmake.

-	SunPro Make: The environment SUN_MAKE_COMPAT_MODE=POSIX is now an
	alternate method to switch dmake into POSIX mode. Before, the path to
	SunPro Make needed to end in "/xpg2/bin/make".

-	SunPro Make: Added a workaround for some Linux versions that come with
	an incompatible prototype for bsd_signal() in /usr/include.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make: avoid a "useless statement" warning from clang.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make: Changed a mktemp() call to mkstemp()

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make did not use the -j argument in case it was not in a separate
	argv and in case no other argument followed -j. This caused "dmake -j 8"
	to create up to 8 jobs, but "dmake -j8" to create only up to 2 jobs, as
	the number of jobs was set to the default value.

-	SunPro Make: added some "default:" statements to make clang quiet.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	SunPro Make: Setting SUN_MAKE_COMPAT_MODE to an empty value now disables
	support for multiple include files with a single include statement.

-	SunPro Make: The program now supports the directives "export" and
	"unexport". This allows to avoid repeated calling of shell commands
	to fill macros in sub-make programs.

-	SunPro Make: The program now supports the "readonly" directive.
	This allows to prevent macros from being modified later.

-	SunPro Make: The program now supports the "-include" directive.
	This allows to continue after a failing include statement.

-	SunPro Make: "dmake -version" now returns Copyright information for the
	authors (Sun Microsystems and Jörg Schilling) together with the other
	information.

-	smake: the error "Recursion in dependencies..." is no longer printed when
	a Makefile e.g. contains a line like:

		o=o

	This bug has been introduced in March 2015.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	smake: psmake/Makefile has been updated to match current source state

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	smake: The fallback implementation for putenv() and unsetenv() has been
	moved into libschily.

-	Bourne Shell: "builtin -d name" did only work for the first element
	in the linked list of active loaded builtins.

-	Bourne Shell: The new optimized pipe handling method introduced in
	November 2015 did still have problems with job control. The left side
	of a pipe was typically not put into jobcontrol. A command line like:

		md5sum | more

	did result in a "md5sum" program that was stopped by a SIGTTIN and a 
	command line like:

		sccs diffs `cat filenames ` | more

	did not print anything in many cases because "more" dies from a
	SIGTTOU.

	The shell now correctly decides to do jobcontrol for the left side of
	a pipe as well.

-	Bourne Shell: man page: Fixed a typo

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	star: When star is in interactive extract mode, it now asks for file
	removal in case that the attempt to create a new file returns ELOOP.
	This helps to extract archives that change the current symlink
	structure and that may result in an intermediate endless symlink loop.

-	star: Avoiding a warning from the HP-UX K&R compiler

-	star: A problem in btrfs on Linux may cause stat.st_blocks == 0 for
	huge files that start with a big hole and end with data. While this
	seems to be a bug in btrfs (stat.st_blocks has been reported to
	become != 0 later), there is the theoretical case where a huge hole
	is followed by data that may fit in compressed form into the "inode"
	and legally result in stat.st_blocks == 0.

	We thus disabled the F_ALL_HOLE test. A modern filesystem should
	implement support for SEEK_HOLE, for performance reasons. Note that
	SEEK_HOLE exists since 13 years already. An operating system or
	filesystem that today does not support SEEK_HOLE must be seen as
	outdated.

-	star/pax.c: Removed a leftover debug print statement that was added in
	September 2017 while adding support for the POSIX option parser
	requirement that the last character in a combined option string may
	have an argument.

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	star: Fixed some typos

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	sfind: man page: Fixed typos

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	sdd: man page: Fixed typos

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	ved: man page: Fixed typos

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	termcap: Fixed typos

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	SCCS: man pages: Fixed typos

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	SCCS: val.c: Fixed typos

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.

-	SCCS: sccslog.c: removed the debug print "Einträge"

	Thanks to Leah Neukirchen for reporting.




-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
