New features with AN-2011-05-08:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****

-	A compile variant of the SCCS system (use "smake COPTX=-DGMT_TIME")
	that results is a SCCS system that archives GMT based times inside
	the SCCS history files has been made more more robust and more correct.

	This compile variant has been introduced by Sun a while ago, but it
	was not cleanly portable and it did not work correctly when close to
	a DST switch time, as it abused the function localtime(), introduced
	math based on "timezone" and assumed that all DST variants add one
	hour to the winter time.

	The new code is based on a new function mkgmtime() that only needs
	to know the Gregorian calendar and based on correct usage of the POSIX
	time functions. 

	The change is a preparation for a future enhancement to SCCS that
	will make it time zone independent.

-	The messages from the SCCS val program have been unified and made better
	readable.

-	The SCCS val program now checks for problems in the statistics lines
	from SCCS history files in case the -T option has been used.

-	The SCCS val program now gives more harmonized debug messages.

-	SCCS now checks whether the 'x' flag in the SCCS history files has the
	tag "SCHILY", as the SCO sccs implementation uses the x flag for setting
	the executable permission on files.

-	SCCS now warns if currently unsupported uppercase flags are present in
	a history file.

-	sccs help now includes help for all help codes

-	The sccsfile.4 man page now mentiones that year numbers may be 4 digit
	numbers also.

-	Make some of the sccs commands compile again on HP-UX after the
	sources have been converted to use strlcpy(). This needs libschily
	on some platforms.

-	The sccslog(1) command now implements a new option -a to prevent sccslog
	from collecting deltas with the same delta comment in case they happen 
	within 24 hours. Not collecting such deltas makes it easier to understand
	the exact time line in changes.

-	The diff(1) command delivered with SCCS now outputs the correct time stamp
	format for unified diffs (-u) as required by POSIX. This is needed in order
	to be able to automatically remove removed files by patch(1).

-	The patch(1) command now supports to automatically remove files in case the
	patch has been created by "diff -Nur". This only works in non-POSIX mode.
	So either call "opatch" or POSIXLY_CORRECT= patch to switch patch into a
	mode similar to GNU patch.

-	The patch(1) command now includes a -E option like GNU diff.
