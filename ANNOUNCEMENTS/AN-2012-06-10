New features with AN-2012-06-10:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	The alias implementation in the bsh has been enhanced to allow
	to use the same code for the Bourne Shell also.

-	The bsh now also support a new "dosh" command that is compatible
	to the new "dosh" command in the Bourne Shell.

-	The Bourne Shell man page now mentions for the option -c that the 
	next argument after the commend-string is $0

-	A new Bourne Shell built-in command "dosh" was added. This command
	behaves similar to sh -c 'command', but does not launch a new shell.
	This command helps to allow to define more powerful aliases.

-	The Bourne Shell now automatically sets the -i option in case it
	detects an interactive shell. This makes it easier to check whether
	in an interactive shell or not.

-	The Bourne Shell no longer tries to read directories when a directory
	name was used when a script name is expected.

-	The Bourne Shell now supports POSIX "set -o ..." and "set +o ...".
	This was needed in order to permit new options that do not have
	a single character equivalent.

-	The environment variable ENV is now supported as defined in the
	POSIX standard. 

-	The Bourne Shell now reads the scripts /etc/sh.shrc and $HOME/.shrc
	when it is launched as interactive shell. The content of the
	enviroment variable ENV allows to control this behavior:

	-	If ENV is defined at startup, it's content is evaluated
		and then used as the file name instead of the default
		$HOME/.shrc

	-	If ENV (after evaluation) starts with "/./" or "./", 
		the system start up script /etc/sh.shrc is not called.
		This ic for compatibility with ksh93.

-	The Bourne Shell now supports aliases.

	-	Basic alias support includes transient aliases as defined
		by POSIX.

	-	Enhanced alias support includes persistent aliases.
		As this is in conflict with some of the rules for aliases
		from POSIX, this feature needs to be explicitely turned on.
		This is usually done in the file /etc/sh.shrc or $HOME/.shrc

	-	Enhanced alias support includes support for persistent
		directory local aliases.
		As this is in conflict with some of the rules for aliases
		from POSIX, this feature needs to be explicitely turned on.
		This is usually done in the file /etc/sh.shrc or $HOME/.shrc

	-	Switching on support for persistent global aliases is done
		by calling "set -o globalaliases".

	-	Switching on support for persistent local aliases is done
		by calling "set -o localiases".


-	A new command "alias" in the Bourne Shell allows to set up or list
	aliases. As the Bourne Shell supports advanced aliases, the alias
	command implements many options that are not part of the POSIX
	standard.

-	A new command "unalias" in the Bourne Shell allows to remove
	aliases. As the Bourne Shell supports advanced aliases, the unalias
	command implements many options that are not part of the POSIX
	standard.
