New features with AN-2015-04-08:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	cpp now supports the environment variable SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES to create
	auto-dependencies for SunPRO-make.

-	bsh/ved/Bourne Shell no longer access bytes after the null byte in strings
	when establishing maps. This is also a bug discovered by Heiko Eißfeldt
	while analyzing the Bourne Shell.

-	The Bourne Shell now supports enhanced debugging information for the
	parser result tree if compiled with:

		smake CPPOPTX=-DPARSE_DEBUG


-	Heiko Eißfeldt started with test on the Bourne Shell using the
	test software: "american fuzzy lop"

	-	sh/io.c::copy() now corrects some other global pointers
		after a GROWSTAK() call. This was a bug introduced by the
		conversion from sbrk() to malloc()/free().

		This fix has been corrected since the last published version

	-	sh/xec.c now saves and restores "standin" in case of
		a vfork() call as the vfork() child may push() something
		on top of standin. This fixes a bug introduced in June 2014.

	-	sh/cmd.c has been changed in function skipnl() to create a
		Bourne Shell syntax error in case of a command like:

			/bin/echo foo |;

		To switch off this "bug" fix, there is a new
		#define DO_PIPE_SEMI_SYNTAX_E that is needed to make the fix
		active.

	-	xec.c::execute() no longer tries to access com[1]. This was
		never correct but no real problem as long as the Bourne Shell
		was using sbrk() instead of malloc()/free().
