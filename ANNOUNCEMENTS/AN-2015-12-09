New features with AN-2015-12-09:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Fix the new include code for posix/malloc.h from Haiku in
	include/schily/stdlib.h that was introduced incorrectly with 
	the last release.

-	New autoconf test for AIX arpa/aixrcmds.h

-	include/schily/netdb.h now may #include <arpa/aixrcmds.h>

-	inc/align_test.c avoids some warnings with GCC-4.8.3

-	Make rs6000-aix-gcc.rul aware of 64 bit support and create links:
	rs6000-aix-gcc32.rul rs6000-aix-gcc64.rul

-	Trying to make rs6000-aix-cc.rul aware of 64 bit support and
	create links:
	rs6000-aix-cc32.rul rs6000-aix-cc64.rul

	Note that this code could not yet be tested because of the lack of a
	compiler

-	Trying to add support for CCOM=gcc64 on IRIX

-	Added new files RULES/os-mingw32_nt-6.*.id

-	mkisofs/diag all diagnostic helper programs had a typo in the usage()
	-inore-errs instead of -ignore-errs
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	mkisofs/diag/isoinfo.c: add a directory loop recognition to avoid
	endless loops that eat up all memory with file system images that
	contain loops.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for doing some handcrafted
        tests based on iso images created by "american fuzzy lop".

-	mkisofs/diag/isoinfo.c: now adds write permission to directories only
	temporarily.

-	Cdrtools bumped to 3.02a03

-	mkisofs/diag/isovfy.c add a directory loop regognition to avoid
	endless loops that eat up all memory with file system images that
	contain loops.

-	mkisofs: make sure that the stream media filename honors the
	-omit-version-number option

-	mkisofs: use the correct directory size for the stream media filename.
	mkisofs did write 1 Byte too few data in case of an odd file name length.

-	mkisofs/diag all diagnostic helper programs had a typo in the usage()
	speficied instead of specified

-	mkisofs + diag all diagnostic helper programs have been vulnerable
	to endless loops when a defective iso image with Rock Ridge was read.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for running related automated tests.

-	star: avoid a warning from GCC-4.8.3

-	translit: avoid a warning from GCC-4.8.3

-	bsh and Bourne Shell: abbrev.c modified to keep the AIX linker happy
	with the variable "deftab"

-	Bourne Shell: jobs.c avoid a warning from GCC-4.8.3

-	Bourne Shell: jobs.c now handles the problems from AIX:

	AIX is not POSIX compliant as it comes with a broken waitid() interface.
	So we need to emulate waitid() with waitpid().

	AIX defines WSTOPPED != WUNTRACED even though they define the same
	feature so we need to be careful with our waitid() emulation that 
	is based on waitpid().

	This problem was caused from enhancements that changed the wait
	code to call waitid() (+ a possible waitpid() based emulation) 
	instead of directly calling waitpid(). The final hang problem
	on AIX was caused by the move from WUNTRACED -> WSTOPPED with
	schily tools 2015-11-26

-	Bourne Shell: builtin.c add a hint that a vanilla printf() should
	be avoided as the Bourne Shell by default does not support stdio.

-	Bourne Shell: restructure echo.c to prepare a printf
	builtin.

-	Bourne Shell: echo now supports \a as defined by POSIX

-	Bourne Shell: a printf builtin command was added.

-	Bourne Shell: a new option parsing routine was implemented to allow
	most option-less builtins to understand "--" in future.

-	Bourne Shell: the new pipe handling now seems to be mature enough
	for daily use.

-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Parameter substitution with these constructs:

		${#parameter}
		${parameter%[word]}
		${parameter%%[word]}
		${parameter#[word]}
		${parameter##[word]}

	- IFS first char as separator for "$*" expansion

	- Command Substitution with $(cmd)

	- Arithmetic Substitution with $((expression))

	- "--" support for some builtin commands is missing

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	write a printf builtin

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	Implement ". -h" as a replacement for "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
