New features with AN-2011-04-12:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****


-	Fixed a typo in star/buffer.c that caused star to dump core
	on Linux with -c -mulvivol due to the unusual memory layout found
	on Linux.

-	The star -multivol buffer management now mallocs less memory.
	Before it malloc()d the same size as the FIFO size, now it only
	malloc()s 2 * bufsize

-	star -c -find is now interruptable by ^C

-	star -x -U -k now works as well as star -x -U -keep-old

-	Some typo fixes in star.4 man page

-	Star -sparse -force-hole now archives all files as sparse files in case
	that they at least contain 512 block aligned bytes of nulls.
	Thanks to markk@clara.co.uk

-	star -find now removes leading "./" in filenames as star does in
	other cases.

-	star -r/-u now correctly depends on the old archive format type.

-	cdrecord now warns and aborts if someone tries to write more CD-Text
	for a single language than permitted by the standard.

-	Fixed several typos in the cdda2wav man page. Thanks to John Bradshaw
	for reporting.

-	Added several forgotten alias names for options to the mkisofs
	man page.

-	cdrtools version bumped to 3.01a04

-	hdump(1) / od(1) now correctly indents the output if single byte
	and floatingoint output was requested at the same time.

-	A new program was added: patch
	This is based on the last patch(1) implementation from Larry Wall
	and in contrary to the GNU fork from the same software, it tries to be
	closer to the POSIX standard requirements.

-	libscg/scsi-bsd.c tries to better support the SCSI sense data
	length in the recently upgrades in FreeBSDs ATAPI/CAM module.

-	try to keep SCSI status and error codes when doing a manual GET SENSE
	on AIX, UnixWare, VMS, Linux Parallel Port, Apollo Domain

-	The val(1) cmmand now includes a -T (debug) option that allows to get 
	much better mesages when a SCCS history file is corrupted. Use:
	sccs val -T filename

-	The SCCS man pages have been enhanced in order to include the -V (retrieve
	program version) option.

-	The man page sccsfile.1 now mentiones the new 'x' flag for the enhanced SCCS
	keywords.

-	The man page for sccs.1 and val.1 now mention the -T option

-	Added missing directories to the SCCS package description file.

-	The sccsdiffs script now includes a -V option
