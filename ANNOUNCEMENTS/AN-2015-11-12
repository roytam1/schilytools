New features with AN-2015-11-12:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Makefile system: the rules for running "configure" have been changed so
	that an updated autoconf/configure file only results in a single
	"configure" run as now, the two resulting files are both removed before
	"configure" is called.

-	Trying to support "Minix" and "Bitrig" in config.guess and config.sub.

-	star now flushes the verbose file stream before checking for missing
	links. This tries to avoid mixed output when people call
		star  2>&1 | tee

-	mkisofs -> isoinfo: Implement a workaround for filesystem images that
	have been created with "mkisofs -r" and add directory write permission
	for the owner if not run by root.

-	mkisofs -> isoinfo: Call chmod() after chown() to avoid a reset
	of the suid and sgid bits.

-	mkisofs -> isoinfo: Skip the "rr_moved" directory in Rock Ridge mode.

-	mkisofs -> isoinfo: Support for following relocated Rock Ridge
	directories was added.

-	smake: make.h now contains a typedef for date_t that is compatible with
	sizeof (time_t) == 8 on a 32 bit platform. This follows a comment from
	2001 when there was no related autoconf test yet.
	This makes smake work on Minix 3.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	Added support for Minix 3 in the makefile rules.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	bsh: Use our wait3() emulation only if waitid() is present.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: The parser and the interpreter have been rewritten to make
	all simple commands from a pipeline children of the main shell and in
	order to make the rightmost programm an unforked shell builtin if it is
	a builtin. This permits e.g.

		echo bla | read var

	to set the shell macro "var" in the main shell.

	As this was a major rewrite, please test and report problems!
	
-	Bourne Shell: jobs -p now correctly prints the progress group id for jobs 
	instead of printing the process id of the rightmost process.


-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
