New features with AN-2012-05-06:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	libxtermcap: MAXLOOP 32 -> 64 because Dickey Termcap File needs 63
	New function e_tcname() prints terminal name
	tchktc() no longer prints "Bad termcap entry" if entry is empty
	\? as alias for \177

	-	\a is now recognised as Terminfo specific quoting.

-	The termcap(1) program:

	-	\a is now recognised as Terminfo specific quoting.

	-	Fixed many comment strings in the interncal capabilities table

	-	..DISABLED, ..OBSOLETE, ..UNKNOWN are now always before
		tc= entries in the output.

	-	By default, unknown capabilities are now at the end of their
		respective block (BOOL, INT, STRING) when in compile mode.
		Before, they have been at eht end of all capabilities
		with a ..UNKNOWN marker.

	-	unknown capabilities are now requoted when inorder
		output is in effect.

	-	New option -noinorder to switch to the previous behavior.

	-	New option -s makes termcap behave similar to tset(1)

	At the same time, hundreds of bugs in the Dickey termcap file
	have been fixed. It seems that Mr. Dickey now uses our termcap
	program to verify the content of the file for correctness.


-	Bourne Shell: A bug introduced by AT&T with SVr3 (when making the
	Shell 8-bit clean in 1986), that causes:

		var=none;echo ${var-'$'}

	to abort with "bad substitution" instead of just printing "none"
	has been fixed.

-	A bug introduced by Sun while trying to fix Sun bug 6776989 was fixed.

		f(){}; type f

	did print:
		f() {f() { }}

-	Bourne Shell: smake COPTX=-DMY_GMATCH now enforces to use our local
	gmatch.c instead of linking gmatch() against -lgen.

	This help to check whether the OS specific gmatch() implementation
	is bug free. Please report if your OS gmatch() is buggy.

-	In December 2006, when the command history editor from bsh has been
	added to the Bourne Shell, only the "history" command was added as a
	builtin. Now, more builtin commands from bsh have been added to the
	Bourne Shell:

	-	savehistory	Save the current history in $HOME/.history

	-	map		Handle input mappings. This command first
				appeared in bsh in April 1986

-	The man page of the Bourne Shell now contains a mostly complete
	description of the history editor.

-	Bourne Shell: a new "repeat" command similar to the repeat command
	in bsh has been implemented as Bourne Shell builtin.

-	Bourne Shell: the variable PWD= is now supported with the cd and pwd
	builtin commands.

-	Bourne Shell: the initial date for the sbrk()-free stak.c
	implementation from Geoff Collyer has been corrected from
	1999 to 1987 with help from Henry Spencer.

-	The bsh map command now correctly displays DEL as ^? instead of ^_

-	The bsh map command now also accepts options -u and -r as the
	Bourne Shell

-	The builtin env command from bsh now correctly implements the -i
	option and no longer sets up CWD= before callong the new command.

-	map.c (used by sh, bsh and ved) now has better defaults for
	cursor mappings.
