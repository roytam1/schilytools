-	Print a hint to the mkisofs option -no-limit-pathtables in case that there are more

-	Mkisofs print hints on using -joliet-long or on avoiding -J in case that there are
	file names that do not fit into 64 chars.

-	Ved now installs it's help file intop */share/man/help/ instead of */man/help/

-	The Bourne shell now also comes with man pages for "bosh" "jsh" and "pfsh"

-	A man page was created for the "label" command.

-	New (previously missing) man pages:
	bsh/pfbsh.1 sh/bosh.1 sh/jsh.1 sh/pfsh.1 mt/mt.1 scgskeleton/scgskeleton.1 label/label.1
	star/ustar.1 star_sym/star_sym.1 ved/ved-e.1 ved/ved-w.1

-	Some smaller fixes in the man pages:
	mountcd/mountcd.1 readcd/readcd.1 udiff/udiff.1 pxupgrade/pxupgrade.1 star/spax.1

-	A new make macro STRIPFLAGS allows to install stripped binaries by calling
	smake STRIPFLAGS=-s install

-	Conf-files in /etc/default are now installed 0644

-	Man pages are now by default installed in $(INS_BASE)/share/man
	The base directory "share" may be changed by caling 

		smake DEFMANBASE=something

-	README.compile now mentions:

	INS_RBASE=		Set different "root" install path
	DEFMANBASE=		Set different man base directory
	STRIPFLAGS=-s		Strip all binaries with "make install"
	RUNPATH=		Overwrite ELF RUNPATH
	DEFUMASK=		Set different default permissions for
				creating directories
	DEFINSUMASK=		Set different default permissions for
				creating directories in the install path

-	Man pages are now by default installed in $(INS_BASE)/share/man
	The base directory "share" may be changed by caling 

-	All Makefile.dfl now detect whether /etc/default/* already exists

-	Cdrecord now auto-formats unformatted (maiden) BD-RE media.
