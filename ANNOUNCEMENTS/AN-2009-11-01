New features with AN-2009-10-99:

-	include/schily/types.h now includes <types.h> in case that it exists
	and <sys/typres.h> is missing

-	New static (non-autoconf based) defines for VMS in 
	include/schily/xmconfig.h:

	#     define  HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H
	#     define  HAVE_STRUCT_TIMEVAL
	#     define  HAVE_RENAME
	#     define  HAVE_PUTENV
	#     define  HAVE_STRNCPY

	.... and more ;-)

-	Trying to add support for OpenVMS to RULES/*


-	Prevent a compiler warning when compiling 64 bit binaries on HP-UX
	using make CCOM=cc64

-	libschily/*bytes.c now support 64 bit compilation and use a "ssize_t"
	typed count parameter instead of "int".

-	include/schily/dbgmalloc.h new to support libdbgmalloc

-	New library libdbgmalloc allows easy debugging of memory problems.

-	bsh/alloc.c now includes the debugging code needed for libdbgmalloc.

-	bsh/alloc.c now has better comments

-	bsh/alloc.c now aligns to max type (which is 16 on must 64 bit platforms)

-	The sdd comand now is able to write in bigger chunks than 2 GB when
	compiled as 64 bit program.

-	New man page for the rscsi program.

-	The rscsi daemon now returns version information for the basic libscg
	while no SCSI device is open.

-	cdda2wav now correctly deals with the case when no sound device
	was specified. Thanks to Robert Grimm <rob@news.robgri.de>
	for reporting.

-	The VMS C-compiler does not distinct between upercase and lowercase 
	symbols. Changed some symbols in "smake" to make all symbols unique
	for the case insensitive case.

-	GNV (GNU is not VMS) comes with bash-1.14 and this bash version does
	not play nicely with ./smake -version && exit
	Changed psmake/MAKE-all to use an "if" statement instead.

-	The GNV CC wrappe to the VMS C-compiler does not like -Iinclude.
	Changed psmake/MAKE-sh to -I./include

-	New option -force-config for psmake/MAKE-sh

-	psmake/MAKE-sh no longer by default tries to call "./configure" on VMS

-	psmake/MAKE-sh by default uses CC=cc on VMS as there is no real gcc
	but a wrapper for the DEC cc.

-	psmake/cpfiles lnfiles and rmlinks now also check for *_in in hope to 
	support the VMS filesystem that does not support more than one "." in 
	a filename.

-	smake now understands that VMS hast utsname.arch for uname -p

-	The bourne shell was modified in hope to avoid all warnings for
	#ident and #pragma ident that did appear on HP-UX

-	Cdrtools bumped to 2.01.01a67
