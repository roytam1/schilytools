New features with AN-2013-12-24:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	libschily::format.c (printf) now supports length modifiers
	like h hh l ll t z for the %n format.

-	libschily::format.c has been restructured for parsing the
	field width parameters in a way that would allow to later
	introduce support for %n$

-	cdda2wav now prints the number of read operations per track when
	in paranoia mode

-	cdda2wav now prints the read overhead (in percent) per track when
	in paranoia mode

-	cdda2wav adds a new paraopts= mode: "c2check" to run libparanoia
	in C2 mode.

-	libparanoia now implements the first stage in C2 error pointer
	support: it now is able to deal with input data that contains
	C2 pointers and it implements new callbacks to report C2
	statistics back to the caller.

-	cdda2wav did get a major overhoul for libparanoia that may
	make the extract quality better up to a factor of 100x:

	A new suboption "readahead=" for paraopts= allows to modify
	the read ahead buffer size to make it large ebough for the amount
	of RAM in modern drives.

	The interpratation of "problem sectors" was changed to better deal
	with the fact that in case of bad areas, the libparanoia code
	tends to do repeated reads in those bad areas. The computaion
	of the percentage of bad sectors now takes care of reread sectors.
	Repeated reads still increase the value but no longer in a
	quadratical way.

-	Better documentation for the libparanoia interface in cdda2wav
	allows to better understand how it works and how modifying 
	parameters could influence the extract quality.

-	Fixed some typos in cdrecord

-	Fixed a typo in the mkisofs man page (had \-max\-ISO-9660\-filenames
	instead of \-max\-iso9660\-filenames)


-	New Schily Makefiles rules for armv7l-linux
