New features with AN-2012-12-28:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	cdrtools bumped to 3.10a10

-	psmake/Makefile works again

-	psmake/MAKE-sh now includes job.o while linking

-	Smake -help now outputs help for -S

-	Smake now correctly implements the '+' command line prefix even
	when it has been called with -t (touch).

-	smake now updated to version 1.2.2

-	libschily/comerr.c now has a new comment for the problems of
	folding the exit code to 8 bits.
