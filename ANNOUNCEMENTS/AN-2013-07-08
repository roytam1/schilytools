mNew features with AN-2013-07-08:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	ved: a bug in the swap buffer handling was fixed. The bug could
	cause data corruption in the second file if two files are edited,
	more then 80 KB from the beginning of the first file was deleted
	and then a change to the second file was initiated.

-	ved: executing a macro that makes use of paste buffer file name
	expansion did result in a null byte in the resulting shell command
	that was accepted by all shells except bash.

-	Libparanoia: memset() call in i_silence_match() now uses the 
	correct size instead of sizeof (avec).

	Thanks to a hint from Andrew Dudman <ajdudman@sbcglobal.net>

-	Libparanoia: Use dynamic arrays instead of alloca()/malloc() 
	if available.

-	Bourne Shell: brkincr.h removed - no longer needed sincs ehe
	Bourne Shell was converted from sbrk() to malloc().

-	Bourne Shell: allocjob() is no longer called with out of
	context data that was freed before.
	This was not a problem on systems with malloc() derived from
	historic UNIX implementations nor a problem on older sbrk()
	based Bourne Shells
	Thanks to a hint from Steffen Daode Nurpmeso <sdaoden@gmail.com>
	who discovere the problem on FreeBSD

-	Bourne Shell: freejobs() no longer follows a linked list using
	out of context data that was freed before.

	based Bourne Shells

-	Bourne Shell: The "type" builtin now knows about aliases

-	Bourne Shell: make COPTX=-DNO_SIGSEGV now allows to compile
	a shell that  does not catch SIGSEGV and thus allows to debug
	memory problems.

-	Bourne Shell: aliases now support begin alias expansion for the
	next word if alias expanded before ends in a space character.
