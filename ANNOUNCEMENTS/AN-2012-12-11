New features with AN-2012-12-11:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	The Bourne Shell now also supports:

		for i; do ... done
	and
		for i;
		do
			....
		done

	For orthogonality with "for i in list; do ... done".
	This is a result from a recent POSIX (SUS issue 7) discussion.

	See http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/bourne_args/
	and http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=581
	as background information.

-	The man page for the Bourne Shell has been manually fixed to avoid the
	cruft inserted by Sun as a result from a troff -> SGML -> troff
	conversion.

-	cpp now defines __BUILTIN_VA_ARG_INCR like the Sun cpp does since
	SunOS-4.0

-	Introduce a dependency for man page subdiretories to allow syncing 
	parallel make calls.

-	Try to support Debian with FreeBSD kernel

-	Support for Pyro (a Syllable clone) was added.
	Thanks to Flemming H. Sørensen

-	Better support for Win32 sockets when using cl.exe

-	Avoid problems with the non-standard prototypes for link() unlink()
	read() and write() from cl.exe

-	Add support for semi-static (preconfigured) include files for Android:
	include/schily/armv5tejl-linux-gcc/xconfig.h

-	New include files include/schily/err_*.h are used to encapsulate
	#error CPP statements that would otherwise always prevent compilation
	with K&R compilers.


-	Libschily is now linked against $(LIB_INTL) when a shared libschily
	is created.

-	Avoid warnings from cl.exe for libschily/gettimeofday.c

-	Some CSTYLE changes

-	While introducing the new option -modification-date to mkisofs, we did
	accidently remove the code to set up the creation date in te PVD.
	Now creation date again contains correct data.


-	Cdrtools have been bumped to 3.01a09

	-	Note that compared to 3.01a09, a bug with DVD-Video has been fixed.

-	Better handling of CLONE AREAs with cdda2wav on newer Haiku versions.

-	Avoid a 32 bit integer overflow in mkisofs while computing sector
	addresses for Rock Ridge CE entries.

-	A mkisofs compile bug with QNX was corrected

-	A new option -ignore-error alows to continue on some errors in all 
	programs from the mkisofs suite.
