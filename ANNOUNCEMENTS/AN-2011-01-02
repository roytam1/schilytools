New features with AN-2011-01-02:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****


-	Since libschily added support for retrieving argv[0] via
	RTLD_DI_ARGSINFO, the portable smake compile directory "psmake" did
	miss the file include/schily/dlfcn.h. This file has been added to 
	the scripts that create links into the directory "psmake.

-	libscg/scsi-bsd.c tries to better support the SCSI sense data
	length in the recently upgrades in FreeBSDs ATAPI/CAM module.

-	star/header.c now uses a new structure "ndbuf" that defines 
	a namelength of 101 instead of 100 in order to be able to access
	the 101th element in the arrays without accessing an aray out of
	bounds.
