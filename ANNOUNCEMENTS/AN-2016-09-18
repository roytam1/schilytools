New features with AN-2016-09-18:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	include/schily/sha3.h Cstyle changes

-	include/schily/stdio.h Cstyle changes

-	include/schily/shedit.h Hdrstyle changes

-	Various ".locals" files modified to be based on the "dosh" builtin
	that is common to "bsh" and "Bourne Shell".

-	patch: Now using getdelim() directly if available on the current
	platform.

-	patch: New option -Wv / -Wversion prints the current patch version
	and a conformance list taken from "POSIX", "Wall-2.0", "Wall+"

-	patch: Man page now correctly mentions the SYNOPSIS for the patch
	versions that are based on POSIX rather then only the Larry Wall
	patch-2.x behavior.

-	bsh/libshedit: Support for the POSIX variables HISTFILE and HISTSIZE
	was added. The historic behavior from 1984 is implemented as fallback,
	so HISTORY is used if HISTSIZE is missing and $HOME/.history is
	used if HISTFILE is missing.

-	bsh/libshedit: increment "ctlc" with "^C" only for bsh but not for
	libshedit as the Bourne Shell cannot reset this variable and would
	otherwise stop doing TAB expansion after ^C has been typed on a
	command line.

-	Bourne Shell: reset the variable pointed to by "intrptr" in
	"savehistory" to avoid to inhibit TAB expansion after "savehistory"
	was aborted via ^C.

-	Bourne Shell: "history" is now interruptable by ^C.

-	libshedit: shedit_bhist() now has a "int **ctlcpp" parameter to allow
	"history" to be interuptable.

-	Bourne Shell: Now all modified shell variables are marked for export
	when set -a is in effect. This did previously exclude the variables
	set or modified by "getopts(1)".

-	Bourne Shell: PWD is now initialized at program start as required by
	POSIX.

-	Bourne Shell: the man page was slightly rewritten to make the text
	better to understand when parts of the man page are used in other
	OpenSolaris man pages. This is done in separate man pags for shell
	builtins.

-	Bourne Shell: man page now documents the shell variable BEEP that
	was introduced in year 2000 in the history editor for silent operation
	in meetings.

-	Bourne Shell: man page now documents the shell variables
	HISTFILE and HISTSIZE

-	cstyle: modified an expression to avoid that
		extern _exit()
			__NORETURN;
	will be flagged


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
