New features with AN-2017-06-29:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	configure: The tests for -lsocket and for -lnsl/-lnetwork
	have been better separated to correctly recognize -lnetwork
	on Haiku.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	configure: the vfork() test has been enhanced to check whether
	a modification in the data segment of the child affects the
	parent as well. This feature is used (needed) by the Bourne Shell 
	to signal a ENOEXEC case for shell scripts to the parent and in
	general to report the reason for a failed execve() call back
	to the parent.

	Note that vfork() in Haiku does not share data and thus canot
	be used by the Bourne Shell.

-	configure: a new test AC_STAT_FILES has been written to replace
	AC_CHECK_FILES. AC_CHECK_FILES does not work on Haiku due to
	a bug in "bash" that makes "test -r /dev/stdin" to report an exit
	code of 0 even though the file /dev/stdin does not exist.

-	Schily Makefilesystem: RULES/rules.loc and RULES/rules.man have been
	made safe against a parallel make program like SunPro Make.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	Schily Makefilesystem: SunPro Make does not understand ".PHONY:".
	Use the AT&T method "FRC" as well to make the .PHONY targets always 
	out of date.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	Schily Makefilesystem: added a new target "uninstall" that removes
	all non-directory type files that previously may have been installed via
	the "install" target.

	Thanks to a report from Michael Siegel

-	smake fixed some GCC warnings for unused variables.

-	smake: include some BSD and Mac OS related include files earlier
	in the file archconf.c in order to get HW_MODEL #defined earlier.

-	cpp: Added a workaround to "Makefile" for a bug in SunPro Make
	that results in not checking for a new file in VPATH.

-	tartest fixed some GCC warnings for unused variables.

-	p: The pager now supports UTF-8 characters. The pattern matcher
	has not yet been enhanced to match any multi byte character by a '?'.

-	Bourne Shell: the behavior for exiting with command substitutions
	has been changed to match general rules for the POSIX shell.

	This causes:

		bosh -c '(set -e; echo ERR `false`; echo ERR); echo OK'

	to print:

		ERR
		ERR
		OK

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: A command substitution no longer sets "retval"
	for $? to make shure, exit/return without parameter use the
	exit value from the last regular command and not the exit code
	from the last command substitution.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: A compliance test has been added for above bug.

-	Bourne Shell: "Y=${X=b} Z=$X; echo $Z" now again prints "b"
	instead of the incorrect "Y=b". This fixes a bug introduced
	2012-04-11 while trying to make the shell be correct even
	when the string stack is relocated as a result from a realloc()
	call.

-	Bourne Shell: A compliance test has been added for above bug.

-	Bourne Shell: There now may be further options between 
	-c and "commandstring" as required by POSIX.

		bosh -c -x 'echo foo'

	and

		bosh -c -o time 'echo foo'

	or

		bosh -c +o time 'echo foo'

	now work. Before, only bosh -c 'command' did work, as 'command'
	was implemented as an option argument for -c.

-	Bourne Shell: When parsing numbers, additional chars after
	digits are now flagged as an error. This prevents the shell
	from silently accepting "shift 0x12" as "shift 0".

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: The parameter expansion ${var-word} now
	processes "word" for IFS field splitting.

	Thanks to a report from Robert Elz

-	Bourne Shell: A compliance test has been added for above bug.

-	Bourne Shell fixed some GCC warnings for unused variables.

-	Bourne Shell: non-existent 2> /dev/null did not redirect the error
	message while /non/existent 2> /dev/null did redirect. This is a
	very old Bourne Shell bug from ~ 1977.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	Bourne Shell: a compliance test was added for above bug.

-	Bourne Shell: The management code in the Bourne Shell used hard links
	to ensure that a shell /tmp File (e.g. representing a here document)
	lives at least as long as the processes that need the file. Hardlinks
	on Haiku are not implemented even though link() exists. We therefore
	now copy the /tmp/ file content to a new /tmp file if errno from
	link() is any other then EEXIST.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	Bourne Shell: a compliance test was added for above bug.

-	Bourne Shell: A bug introduced March 15 2017 was fixed. At that
	time, the expansion for $PS4 was modified to use _macro() instead of
	macro() but _macro() does not reset the "stack top" and thus left
	active text on the stack that was later included while expanding
	e.g. the argument "/dev/null" for "> /dev/null". As a result,
	bosh in -x mode could complain about:

		'+ /dev/null' cannot open

-	Bourne Shell: a compliance test was added for above bug.

-	Bourne Shell: Compliance test sh/tests/shelltests/here/here02.sh
	Test "here24" added a workaround for a ksh93/bash/mksh POSIX
	non-compliance bug. These shells illegally expand "\E" to the ESC
	character when using the built in "echo" command. We changed
	"\EOF" -> "\FIN" in the test "here24" to avoid the problem.

-	Bourne Shell: Compliance test sh/tests/shelltests/error/error.sh
	Tests "error117" ... "error132" have been disabled for Haiku to
	prevent an OS bug to make our test fail. Haiku illegally permits:

		: > /

	as opening the root directory does not fail.

-	Bourne Shell: The shell now passes all compliance tests on Hailu,
	except for the tests named above that fail due to a Haiku OS bug.

-	Bourne Shell: The compliance tests "conf" and "bugs" have been moved
	to the beginning to reduce the test time by making "conf" start first
	and to run the regression tests for fixed bugs first.

-	Bourne Shell: The compliance test "trap03" has been fixed as the old
	PATH detection code for the external "echo" command did not work.

-	SCCS: sccs admin/delta, ... could write nanoseconds to the timestamp
	into the history file even when in SCCSv4 mode and the time stamp is
	from before 1968 or past 2037. This is no longer possible as the
	nanosecods are now cleared in that case.

-	SCCS: val now checks whether a SCCSv4 history file contains SCCSv6
	elements in the delta line. The checks in the schilytools development
	area did not discover the problem, so it seems that our bug was only
	triggered on Haiku due to a time_t implementation bug in the Haiku libc.

-	SCCS: sccs/man/Makefile if now a normal serial Makefile using "rules.mks"
	in order to make all localizations and the directory OBJ/<arch-dir>/man
	which "make all" already. This avoids that OBJ/<arch-dir>/man is created
	late by root when running "make install" as root after a "make all" call
	from a normal user.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make: The path to the file with internal rules now
	is corrctly constructed even when the binary is in .../xpg4/bin/make
	where we need to use "../../share/..." instead of "../share/...".

-	SunPro Make: Install path detection now works on Haiku as well.
	findinpath() only works when the binariy was located via PATH search.
	Use the absolute path in other cases.

	Thanks to a report from Heiko Eiﬂfeldt

-	SunPro Make now has been verified to compile and work correctly on
	Haiku.

	If you like to test SunPro Make with the schilytools, call e.g.

		dmake -f SMakefile

	in the top level directory to prevent the automated redirection to 
	smake.




-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
