New features with AN-2009-11-19:

-	VMS rules now define library names to XX.olb instead of libXX.a

-	New define "NO_STATIC_CONF" allows to switch of the default static
	config on VMS

-	schily/utypes.h enhanced to allow to define maxint_t which is 
	missing on VMS

-	Better autoconf test for union wait vs. int for platforms that
	define union wait but use int as wait() parameter.

-	schily/vfork.h now includes unistd.h as the related definitions 
	are there on Solaris

-	Fixed a configure bug with opendir() inherited from GNU autoconf

-	Enhanced the vfork() autoconf test to avoid a hang on VMS

-	changed a include path in libscg/scsi-mac-iokit.c to allow
	compilation on "Snow Leopard"

-	libschily/spawn.c now uses vfork()

-	smake now uses vfork() to make it work on VMS

-	smake now also supports the "unexport" directive.

-	smake man page enhanced.

-	Some #define inline definitions removed as "inline" is already
	handled by schily/mconfig.h

-	Some code changes to avoid warnings "Cast truncates pointer into 32 bit integer."
	from HP-UX-11.11 compiler

-	libfind is now using vfork() instead of fork() in order to make
	it work on VMS

-	libsiconv no longer tests TAB_SIZE on VMS as the VMS C-compiler does not
	support complex computations in #if statements

-	libfind: VMS has sysconf(_SC_ARG_MAX) and ARG_MAX but no _POSIX_ARG_MAX

-	SCCS was converted from #ident "bla" to 
	#if defined(sun)
	#pragma ident "bla"
	#endif
	to prevent warnings on HP-UX-11.11 with the HP C-compiler

-	The Bourne Shelll was converted from #ident "bla" to 
	#if defined(sun)
	#pragma ident "bla"
	#endif
	to prevent warnings on HP-UX-11.11 with the HP C-compiler

-	SCCS was converted to use vfork() in order to make it work on VMS 

-	Fixed a bug in mkisofs (writing to stdout instead of stderr) recently 
	introduced with better RR recognition support.

-	"isoinfo" now supports iconv() based locales for Joliet.


-	Fixed a typo in libfind/idcache.c

-	Added a workaround to cdrecord for a firmware oddity with DVD+RW on
	'_NEC    ' 'DVD_RW ND-3500AG' with media written from other drives.

-	Added a forgotten modification in cdda2wav/ringbuff.c that caused an abort 
	due to a wrong assert() condition.
