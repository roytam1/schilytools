mNew features with AN-2013-06-20:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Cdrtools bumped to version 3.01a15

-	Cdda2wav now works around a bug in sys/param.h FreeBSD-9.1, that 
	#define's __FreeBSD_kernel__
	instead of #define __FreeBSD_kernel__ 9 that would be needed for Debian
	k-FreeBSD compatibility.
	The bug affects cdda2wav/mycdrom.h

-	The builtins alias/unalias in bsh now behave the same as in the 
	Bourne Shell

-	Bourne Shell man page converted to CDDL-V1.0 only

-	Sccs man pages converted to CDDL-V1.0 only

	The original OpenSolaris code did clearly refer to CDDL version 1.0
	only. Sun later removed this "1.0 only" and then Oracle stopped
	distributing OpenSolaris as OpenSource project. In order to prevent
	harm that could happen if Oracle did publish a CDDL-1.x or CDDL-2.x,
	we need to restrict usage to CDDL-1.0 again.

-	bdiff.1 man page converted to again follow the man(5) rules.

-	diff.1 man page converted to again follow the man(5) rules.

-	sccs-help.1 man page converted to again follow the man(5) rules.

-	sccs-val.1 man page converted to again follow the man(5) rules.

-	sccsfile.4 man page converted to again follow the man(5) rules.

-	what.1 man page converted to again follow the man(5) rules.

-	Most man pages in sccs/man now mention changeset(4) in the SEE ALSO
	section.

-	The SCCS keyword expansion for "Mocsw" has been limited to 
	prevent expansion of date '+%Y%m%d%H%M%S'

-	Mocsw now sets link mode to -Bdirect for recent OpenCSW rules

-	pkgdefs/OCSW/*/checkpkg_override modified to match current OpenCSW
	rules.
