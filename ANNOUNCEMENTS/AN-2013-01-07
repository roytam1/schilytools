New features with AN-2013-01-07:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	smake now optimizes command execution and no longer passes simple
	commands to the shell. On UNIX, this speeds up execution by just
	one percent, but on slow systems like Win32, this results in a
	bigger performance win (aprox. 25% of the total wall clock time
	on a Cygwin system).

-	Commands that start with a simple "echo" command have the echo
	command executed inline by smake. This helps to avoid to call the
	shell for typical commands in the schily makefilesystem.

-	Added a symlink to libschily/stdio/flush.c to get flush() for "echo"
	into the bootstrap "psmake".

-	If the remaining commandline does not contain shell meta characters,
	the command is called via execlp() instead of the shell.

-	If the environment FORCE_SHELL is present or the Makefile contains
	the special target .FORCE_SHELL:, smake always calls commands via
	the shell.

-	For newer Cygwin versions, we need  an own PACKED definition in
	libscg/scg/aspi-win32.h

-	Try to work around an imprudent change in the file windef.h from
	Cygwin-1.7.17 (Autumn 2012) related to the type BOOL that makes 
	windefs.h from the recent Cygwin no longer compatible to the 
	original file from Microsoft.

	Thanks to Alain Hoang, Thomas Plank and others for reporting and
	help with getting a fix for the two problems named above


-	The make program specific configuration files for the Schily Makefilesystem
	RULES/mk-.id (for SunPro make), RULES/mk-smake.id RULES/mk-gmake.id
	now include definitions for the macros:

	SPACE		A single space character (' ')
	NUMBER_SIGN	The ASCII number sing ('#')

	Note that the POSIX standard otherwise requires the make program 
	to be unable to have the '#' appear in non-comment sections of
	Makefiles.

-	The smake program now may be compiled to enforce "bosh" (our portable
	Bourne Shell) as the default SHELL.

	This fixes some bugs with signal handling on bash based systems
	and increases performace e.g. on Cygwin.

	compile using "smake COPTX=-DUSE_BOSH" to enable this feature.
	Note that you need to have a working bosh installed on your system
	before "configure" was run. So if you like to swith to that
	new feature, first compile/install all programs from this source
	bundle, then call "./.clean" and compile again.

-	If you have a working (recent) bosh on your system, you may call:

	PATH="/opt/schily/bin:$PATH" CONFIG_SHELL=/opt/schily/bin/sh smake

	to enforce "bosh" instead of /bin/sh for executing "configure"
	If /bin/sh is e.g. bash, this speeds up the "configure" performance
	by aprox. 30% on Cygwin.


-	cpp now includes a yacc'd version of cpy.y in cpp/cpypre.c
	that allows to have a full blown cpp even on platforms that do not
	include the "yacc" command.

-	Make the Bourne shell compile again with a K&R compiler.
	The new files alias.c and abbrev.c introduced some inconsisties
	with K&R C.
