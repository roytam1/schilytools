New features with AN-2009-08-31:

-	The schily makefilesystem now by default sets all locale related envronment
	variables to "C" in order to avoid problems.

-	Make the makefile emulation mode for "non-automake aware" make programs
	like SunPro Make and GNU make more immune against oddities in the tr(1)
	program that are seen with a locale that differs from LC_ALL=C
	Another step to prevent some tr(1) oddities was to replace the call to
	tr(1) by a call to sed(1).

-	Calling the script "./.clean" now also removes the auto-created links.

-	Avoid many symlinks to .h files.

-	Added GMAKE_NOWARN=true to allow to disable the gmake warning

-	make smake a bit more robust in order to grant that 
	SHELL= is always defined inside smake

-	Bump smake to 1.2a45

-	Enhanced include/schily/priv.h to distinct Solaris and AIX process privileges

-	New include file include/schily/math.h

-	Try to workaound a problem with GCC on newer AIX versions. It seems that
	gcc on AIX is not C99 compliant and does not support isnan().

	Note that the current solution may compile and run on newer AIX versions
	but does not seem to be the optimal solution as it cannot check whether
	a float is a number or not.

	It is unfortunate, that we do not have an AIX login that would allow
	us to implement better AIX support.
