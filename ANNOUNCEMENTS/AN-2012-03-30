New features with AN-2012-03-30:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	The file COPYING has been reworded to be more obvious with
	explaining work limits.

-	conf/runrmt_android has been enhanced to better deal with the
	"runrmt -r file-to-test" calling variant.

-	cdrecord/cdda2wav/readcd have been converted to be able to run
	completely root-less and suid-root-less and with no script that calls
	pfexec(1). This works on OpenSolaris ONNV_140 or later because the
	functionality of pfexec(1) has been integrated into the kernel.

	To enable this feature. edit the file /etc/security/exec_attr and add:

	Basic Solaris User:solaris:cmd:::/usr/bin/cdrecord:privs=file_dac_read,sys_devices,proc_lock_memory,proc_priocntl,net_privaddr
	Basic Solaris User:solaris:cmd:::/usr/bin/cdda2wav:privs=file_dac_read,sys_devices,proc_priocntl,net_privaddr
	Basic Solaris User:solaris:cmd:::/usr/bin/readcd:privs=file_dac_read,sys_devices,net_privaddr
	or
	Basic Solaris User:solaris:cmd:::/opt/schily/bin/cdrecord:privs=file_dac_read,sys_devices,proc_lock_memory,proc_priocntl,net_privaddr
	Basic Solaris User:solaris:cmd:::/opt/schily/bin/cdda2wav:privs=file_dac_read,sys_devices,proc_priocntl,net_privaddr
	Basic Solaris User:solaris:cmd:::/opt/schily/bin/readcd:privs=file_dac_read,sys_devices,net_privaddr

	depending on where you install cdrecord.
	No special shell is needed anymore.

-	Bumped to cdrtools-3.01a07

-	Bourne Shell: 6568535 shell process running on remote session keeps alive even if a terminal window is closed.

-	Bourne Shell: 6879678 bourne shell echo built-in misinterprets arguments beginning with -n if /usr/ucb is before /usr/bin

-	Bourne Shell: sh/word.c has been reordered to avoid calling the history
	editor (that calls malloc()) while a string is build on the "stack".

-	Bourne Shell: New builtin command "alloc" allows to manually check the
	storage for corruption.

-	Bourne Shell: New funktion fill_pat() allows better storage checking.

-	Bourne Shell: CPPOPTS in Makefile reordered

-	Bourne Shell: CPPOPT "RES" in Makefile documented

-	Bourne Shell: 6776989 Custom backup script core dumping in Bourne shell /usr/bin/sh but not in Korn shell
	"struct fndnod" now uses a new reference-counter "int fndref" for functions instead of "t->tretyp & COMMSK" (4 Bit)
	freetree() is no longer static, as it is not also used in xec.c 
	(struct namnod *)->namenv is now "struct fndnod *" and no longer "(struct fndnod *)->fndval"
	defs.h indented for "command tree" definitions

-	Bourne Shell now contains the latest useful enhancements of "sh" on OpenSolaris
	which are from: ONNV Build 144 Mon Jun 28 10:51:27 2010 +0530

-	Bourne Shell: work around a warning from GCC when compiling in 64 bit mode

-	Bourne Shell: -version/--version/-V is now supported

-	Bourne Shell: All fcntl() calls now use abstract definitions instead
	of just number arguments.

-	Bourne Shell: mark the fd for mmap() mapmep.c "Close on EXEC"
	Note: this only happens on OS that use mepmem.c and that do not
	support to map anomymous memory without a fd to "/dev/zero".

-	Bourne Shell: Some forgotten calls to memcpy() in service.c have been
	converted to memmove() as they deal with overlapping memory.

-	Bourne Shell: Support for in-kernel pfexec from Solaris-11-Build-140
	or later added

-	bsh: Support for in-kernel pfexec from Solaris-11-Build-140
	or later added

-	Bourne Shell: growstak() now returns a value to prepare the shell to 
	be converted to use malloc() instead of sbrk()

-	Bourne Shell: several dozen places now correctly call growstak() and endstak()
	to deal with relocated memory.

-	struct scsi_inquiry is now using a union around the vendor ID strings in
	order to avoid incorrect buffer overflow warnings from GCC-4.x
