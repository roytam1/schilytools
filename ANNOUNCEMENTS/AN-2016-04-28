New features with AN-2016-04-28:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Libgetopt: Some Cstyle changes and a better comment.

-	Libgetopt: man page getopt.3c added. Note, that it is not installed
	automatically as it may be in conflict with the systems getopt() man
	page.

-	Bourne Shell: Does no longer write warnings "cannot export functions"
	as we permit functions and variables with the same name. Even when
	a name currently refers to a function, it may now later become a
	variable too.
	Thanks to Robert Elz <kre@munnari.oz.au> for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: A 32 bit Bourne Shell no longer gets an integer overflow
	while computing the CPU time percentage. This happened e.g. while
	compiling OpenSolaris-ON that takes more than 2 hours on a 2-CPU intel
	machine from today and reported 27% CPU usage while it should have 
	reported aprox. 180% CPU usage.

-	Bourne Shell: I/O redirect errors (e.g. from non existing input files or
	when set -C prevents to clobber files) do no longer cause a shell script
	to exit or an interactive shell to longjmp before the next prompt when
	this happens with a builtin command or function. This is required 
	for POSIX.
	Thanks to Robert Elz <kre@munnari.oz.au> for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: String manipulation:
		${parameter%word}
		${parameter%%word}
		${parameter#word}
		${parameter##word}

	now works correctly even when the above conversions appear in double
	quotes.
	Thanks to Robert Elz <kre@munnari.oz.au> for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: added 12 new tests in the "parameter" section of the
	conformance tests to check whether the above bug reported by Robert
	Elz has been fixed.

-	Bourne Shell: set -e again makes sure that the shell exits even with
	those errors that have recently been made non-fatal by calling:

		command <special builtin>

-	Bourne Shell: New test for the testsuite now checks whether

		sh -ce 'cmd'

	is handled correctly for complex commands. This is the test that 
	is used to detect a failure with bash-3.x in our autoconf.

-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Arithmetic Substitution with $((expression))

	- Do not list functions when calling "set" with no arguments.
	  Note that this POSIX requirement is seen as a POSIX bug as there
	  is no POSIX command to list function definitions.
	  NOTE that this will not be implemented before POSIX bug
	  http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1025 was fixed.

	- A POSIX whitepaper at: http://www.unix.org/whitepapers/shdiffs.html
	  claims that:
			IFS=o; violet

	  should not execute "vi". The normative text in the POSIX standard
	  describes the historic Bourne Shell behavior, but the rationale
	  describes the deviating behavior from "ksh".


	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be SUSv8)

	We are getting very close to full POSIX support.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
