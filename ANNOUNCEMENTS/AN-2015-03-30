New features with AN-2015-03-30:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	smake version is now 1.2.5

-	fixed a typo in smake/parse.c

-	cdrtools was bumped to 3.01a28

-	Fixed a typo in the readcd man page.

-	Support for ARM-64 (aarch64) was added

-	rules.dep (r-make.dep, r-smake.dep, r-gmake.dep) now create 
	$(ARCHDIR)/man together with $(ARCHDIR) tp make shure this
	directory exists before someone calls "*make install" as root.

-	rules.dep (r-make.dep, r-smake.dep, r-gmake.dep) now make sure
	that $(ARCHDIR)/Dnull will not be touched in case it already
	exists. This prevents some unneeded file rebuilds if the make
	program is changed between two builds.

	Note that echo > $(ARCHDIR)/Dnull already enforces a shell (because
	the command contains a ">") and the use of an if statement thus
	does not cause extra costs.

-	$(ARCHDIR)/Dnull no longer depends on $(ARCHDIR), this prevents
	attempts to re-create $(ARCHDIR)/Dnull after an update in $(ARCHDIR)

-	it is now ensured that $(SRCROOT)/incs/Dnull will not be touched
	in case it already exists.

-	TEMPLATES/MKLINKS now creates a dummy link to allow it to recognise
	whether the links already exist.

-	Fixed a typo in libschily/strlcatl.c and libschily/wcslcatl.c that
	prevented compilation on K&R systems.

-	libschily now defined error() as weak symbol that refers to the new
	symbol js_error(). This was done as many programs (e.g. the Bourne 
	Shell) include symbols called error() but with different interfaces.

-	libdbgmalloc was restructured to use js_error() and to easier allow 
	to avoid the include/schily/standard.h BOOL definition. This was needed
	to permit to use libdbgmalloc() to debug memory problems in the
	Bourne Shell.

-	bsh/alloc.c (is the coode for libdbgmalloc) and bsh/signames.c have
	been modified to permit to use libdbgmalloc with the Bourne Shell.

-	Bourne Shell: Makefile now includes CPPOPTS += -DUSE_JS_BOOL to deal
	with the new BOOL code in libdbgmalloc. Compile the Bourne Shell with
	libdbgmalloc by calling:

		cd sh
		smake clean
		smake CPPOPTX=-DDBG_MALLOC LDOPTX=-ldebugmalloc

-	Heiko Eiﬂfeldt started with test on the Bourne Shell using the
	test software: "american fuzzy lop"

	-	sh/jobs.c::allocjob() now correctly checks whether a string
		is long enough to permit to check the second last character.

	-	sh/word.c::readb() now correctly uses memmove() instead of
		memcpy()

	-	sh/io.c::copy() now corrects some other global pointers
		after a GROWSTAK() call. This was a bug introduced by the
		conversion from sbrk() to malloc()/free().

	-	sh/gmatch.c no longer wasts a lot of CPU time if you try to
		expand something like *************g**************
