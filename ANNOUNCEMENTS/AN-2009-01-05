New features with AN-2009-01-05:

-	config.sub and config.guess now support ATARI MiNT

-	All needed definition files for ATARI MiNT are now in RULES/*

-	configure now checks whether shmget() works (needed for ATARI MiNT)

-	Raising PATH_MAX to be at least 1024 for all platforms as Cygwin 
	defines PATH_MAX to 260	which is too small for Cygwin.

-	The GNU linker on Linux now seems to support -R to set the LD_RUN_PATH
	Added support for -R

-	Added definitions to allow dynamic linking with the Sun Studio compiler 
	on Linux

-	Added a new #define (NO_ACL) that alloed to disable ACL support via
	command line when compiling

-	include/schily/libport.h split into include/schily/libport.h and
	include/schily/hostname.h to allow to avoid to include netdb.h for
	applications that do not need gethostname() and getdomainname()

-	include/schily/prototype.h now inlcludes the definitions for const...

-	new autoconf test to check whether the Sun Studio compiler needs 
	-xarch=generic64 or -m64 for 64 bit compilation.

-	New functions eaccess() and findinpath() in libschily

-	rscsi: Raise the SCSI bus numer limit to 1024 to allow the new Linux ATA mapping.

-	cdrecord: New driver "mmc_bdrom" is used for profile 0x40 and allows to
	retrieve the ADIP data for BD-R media that is reported as BD-ROM
	by some drives.

-	cdrecord: Added a workaround for a firmware bug in the drive
	'HL-DT-ST' 'DVD-RAM GH22NP20'
	that reports DVD-R media as media with zero size.

-	cdrecord: Try to call scg_close() before exiting cdrecord.

-	Default Transfer Size in cdrecord reverted from 126 kB to 63 kB.
	Sorry FreeBSD guys - it seems that FreeBSD is the only OS that
	correctly deals with larger DMA sizes.

	FreeBSD people may add a line with CDR_TRANSFERSIZE=126k
	in /etc/default/cdrecord to raise the default.

	The current problems are:

	-	On Solaris 10 Sparc fs=126k causes a kernel panic

	-	On Solaris 11 the drivers partially return incorrect
		max DMA sizes that may cause cdrecord to fail.

	-	On Linux with USB fs=126k may not work at all

	-	On Linux with other interfaces, fs=126k may reduce
		the DMA speed to a value that always causes buffer
		underruns.

	I hope to find a better solution in the next development cycle
	after the current code has been release as stable version.
	Expect the next stable release to appear very soon.


-	mkisofs: Raising PATH_MAX to be at least 1024 for all platforms as Cygwin 
	defines PATH_MAX to 260	which is too small for Cygwin.

-	mkisofs: Implemented a better error message in case that the boot image
	could not be found inside the target tree.

-	mkisofs: A description for the -s/-sector option was added to the man page.
	This option is used to allow to create conforming multi-session
	images for e.g. the Kodak Photo CD or the Kodak Picture CD.

-	mkisofs: A description forr the -XA and -xa option was added to the man page.

-	Mkisofs now writes a better error message in case that it cannot
	sort a directory because more than on directory content was merged
	into the ISO image.

-	isoinfo -d now prints the checksum for the Eltorito validation header

-	star H=help now marks the default archive type

-	star does no longer allow to read/write the archive data from/to a
	terminal

-	bsh and sh now auto-quote more characters when in tab expand mode.

-	Fixed a problem from an unitialized variable that has been introduced
	with built-in pfexec support in bsh.

-	tartest and star_sym now include a -version option

-	libfind now correctly deals with ARG_MAX in case that
	the bitness of the libfind executable differs from the bitness
	of the executable called by -exec name {} +

-	Default install user changed from "bin" to "root".

-	The install-sh script now complains if an attept was made to install
	a program suid or sticky and the install user has no root privileges

-	The makefile system has been modified to allow a separate set-up
	for the install path of the configuration files to e.g. /etc/
	via the DEFAULTS variable INS_RBASE

-	ved no longer wait for 2 seconds in case that the .vedtmp.* file 
	is > 8192 bytes.

-	Cdrecord is now by default installed suid root in case that the caller
	of make install has root privileges

-	the configuration file "cdrecord" is now by default installed into
	/etc/default/cdrecord

-	Some unused variables and functions have been commented out

-	Cdda2wav is now by default installed suid root in case that the caller
	of make install has root privileges

-	Some unused variables and functions have been commented out

-	the configuration file "rscsi" is now by default installed into
	/etc/default/rscsi

-	Readcd is now by default installed suid root in case that the caller
	of make install has root privileges

-	Cdrtools bumped to version 2.01.01a55

-	Avoid some GCC warnings with several programs when compiling with:

		make DEFAULTSDIR=DEFAULTS_ENG CCOM=gcc


-	Avoid GCC "code with no effect" warnings in several SCCS programs
	in case of a compilation on a non-gettext aware platform.

-	SCCS bumped to version 1.00.04

-	Ved bumped to version 1.7a07

-	Wrong "ac" compuation in libschily:fexec.c and libschily:spawn.c corrected.
	The bug has been introduced on October 9th 2008.
