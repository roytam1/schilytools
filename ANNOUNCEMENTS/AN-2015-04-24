New features with AN-2015-04-24:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	include/schily/sysexits.h adopts to the recent changes on Haiku that
	prevent usual autoconf tests as #include <sysexits.h> works but symbols
	are only defined with #define _BSD_SOURCE

-	include/schily/wait.h now knows about the Haiku specific macro
	WIFCORED() and #defines WCOREDUMP() to WIFCORED().

-	The program isaexec(1) has been added to the software. The compilation
	is not yet connected to the global list. If you like to compile isaexec,
	you need to chdir into isaexec/ and call "smake".

-	The programs cdrecord, star and cdda2wav adopt to the recent Haiku
	changes with a randomized address space and now use B_EXACT_ADDRESS
	instead of B_ANY_ADDRESS for the clone_area() call to get shared memory
	for a FIFO.

-	SCCS: sccs/man/Makefile was fixed again. It now still avoids a gmake
	warning but no longer complains about a missing source for the target
	"dummy".

-	SCCS: sccs/sccs/lib/mpwlib/src/setsig.c no longer depends on the exact
	numbers for signals in the range 1..15 for UNIX. As Haiku deviates from
	UNIX starting with signal #5, this change was needed to prevent sccs
	programs from dying from SIGCHLD.

-	SCCS: sccs/sccs/cmd/src/bdiff.c now calls wait.h W*() macros for
	portability to Haiku. Note that Haiku uses a different byte-order
	in the status parameter of wait() than used on UNIX.

-	SCCS: sccs/sccs/cmd/src/diff.c now calls wait.h W*() macros for
	portability to Haiku.

-	SCCS: sccs/sccs/cmd/src/delta.c now calls wait.h W*() macros for
	portability to Haiku.

-	SCCS: sccs/sccs/cmd/src/sccs.c now calls wait.h W*() macros for
	portability to Haiku.

-	Bourne Shell: sh/fault.c no longer depends on the exact numbers for
	signals in the range 1..9 for UNIX. As Haiku deviates from UNIX
	starting with signal #5, this change was needed to prevent the shell
	from dying from SIGCHLD.

-	ved/execcmds.c now calls wait.h W*() macros for
	portability to Haiku.

-	Bourne Shell: sh/io.c now also tries to symlink temp files. This was
	needed as Haiku prevents usual autoconf tests for link() (the function
	is present on Haiku but does not work), we need to check the return
	code from link() and call symlink() if link() fails for errors other
	then EEXIST.

The Bourne Shell is now fully functional on Haiku. It works to use the Bourne 
Shell for calling "configure" and:

  CONFIG_SHELL=/boot/opt/schily/bin/sh /boot/opt/schily/bin/sh ./configure

is aprox. 15-20% faster than bash.

SCCS is now nearly fully functional on Haiku. The following problems stay:

-	test suite calls uncompress(1) that is missing on Haiku 

-	Some time stamp problems exist for times around 1960 in SCCS history files.
