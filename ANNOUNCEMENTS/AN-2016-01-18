New features with AN-2016-01-18:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Schily.Copyright dates updated to reflect changes in the Bourne
	Shell and mkisofs.

-	Cdrtools bumped to 3.02a05

-	mkisofs/write.c: mkisofs -sort with multi extent files (files > 4 GB)
	no longer computes the size of the file twice while computing the
	start sectors for files. This is the second and now complete
	fix for the bug.
	Thanks to a report from Arpad Biro <biro.arpad@gmail.com>

-	mkisofs call free(mroot) in main to quiet the address sanitzier.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	mkisofs: better error messages for rotten ISO-9660 directories
	that are encountered in multi-session mode.
	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	libscg: fix a comparison with the timeout value that was wrong
	because of a wrong copy/paste action. This code fragment is
	used when the Linux kernel returns unspecific SCSI error codes
	and previously caused cdrecord to incorrectly assume a timeout
	that than incorrectly stopped the write operation.

-	libscg: added a debug message (in non-silent mode) that prints
	the sg_io.host_status value in case of unknown states.



-	Bourne Shell: $? now prints the exit code as a signed int (as 
	the parameter for the exit() call is documented as signed int
	in the POSIX standard).

-	Bourne Shell: better comment in ctype.h

-	Bourne Shell now implements the POSIX "command" built-in command.

-	Boure Shell: Parameter substitution with these constructs:
		${#parameter}		-> strlen(parameter)
		${parameter%word}	-> Remove Smallest Suffix Pattern
		${parameter%%word}	-> Remove Largest Suffix Pattern
		${parameter#word}	-> Remove Smallest Prefix Pattern
		${parameter##word}	-> Remove Largest Prefix Pattern

	was added. The Bourne Shell now implements all types of parameter
	substitution that are defined by POSIX.

	With $* $@, all above expansions are unspecified


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Tilde expansion after unquoted ':' in variable assignment

	- Command Substitution with $(cmd)

	- Arithmetic Substitution with $((expression))

	- cd with "-LP" as options

	- pwd with "-LP" as options

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is for the next POSIX
					version that will be SUSv8)

	We are getting very close to full POSIX support.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
