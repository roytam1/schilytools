New features with AN-2015-06-04:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Makefile system: two new targets have been addes:

	man		creates localized versions of the man pages in the
			OBJ directory

	installman	installs only the manual pages

-	Patch: A function pfatal() that uses strerror() has been added to get
	better error messages for syscall errors.

-	Patch: New option -W-posix allows to revert the effect os a previous
	-W+ and -Wposix option.

-	Patch: is*() functions like isspace() now get an argument that is casted
	to unsigned char. This avoids strange effects with chars > 127.

-	Patch: Support to parse the time format from diff -c was added.

-	Patch: Now all numbers are checked for lexcalical correctness - even those
	that are parsed from command line switches.

-	Patch: The verbosity has been reduced in the default case. Patch hunks
	that apply without offset and without fuzz are no longer mentioned by default.
	To get the old behavior, use patch -vv

-	Patch: Some unit tests have been added to the directory patch/tests/.
	To use them: chdir patch/tests and then call "make".

	There are two test methods:

	basic		handcrafted tests to check specific behavior

	random		automated tests that create random diffs and apply them
			to files to check whether unpredictable patches work
			as expected.

	Note that gpatch (the GNU patch implementation) does not pass our tests
	because of POSIX deviations and bugs.

-	Patch: The license is now definitively compatible to the OpenSource.org 
	rules. We now use a 1-clause BSD license with permission from Larry Wall.
	This replaced the original patch license from 1984.
	Thank you Larry!

-	Patch: version has been bumped to 3.1

-	Bourne Shell: added a comment with a list of portable signal numbers
	to fault.c.

-	Bourne Shell: enhanced the man page with better axplanations about
	parameter substitutions.

-	Unit Test subsystem: the "docommand" test macro now includes a new 
	option -noremove to retain the output and error files for separate
	later verification.

-	Unit test subsystem: the directory "testutils" has been moved to
	$SRCROOT/tests/testutils to make it easier to reuse the code.

-	Unit test subsystem: the directory "common" has been moved one directory
	upwards in the tree. This helps to reuse the code.

-	Change: Change now supports arbitrary long lines and no longer adds
	a newline to the last line if there was no lewline in that line.

-	cdrtools have been bumped to version 3.01a29
