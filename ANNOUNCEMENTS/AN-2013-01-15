New features with AN-2013-01-15:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	The Schily makefilesystem now supports CC++_COM for all platforms to
	allow to overwrite the low level command for the C++-compiler.

-	Fixed a bug in smake that has been introduced while trying to 
	optimize shell calls. Empty command lines caused errors in the last 
	version of smake.

-	Fixed a bug in the Bourne Shell that has been introduced in May 2012
	while converting the shell from sbrk() to malloc(). If PATH was
	set to a string that ends in ':', there was a big chance that
	the shell did no PATH search while trying to execute programs.

-	Some more places in the Bourne Shell now correct the actual
	pointer value after a growstak() call.

-	Cdrtools bumped to version 3.01a11

-	Star bumped to version 1.5.2
