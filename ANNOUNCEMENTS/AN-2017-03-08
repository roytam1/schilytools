New features with AN-2017-03-08:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	README.compile was updated and made more readable.

-	star: The NFSv4 ACL format was redesigned following a proposal from
	Martin Matuska <martin@matuska.org> from FreeBSD.

	The new format omits the '-' signs in the output from

		acl_totext(aclp, ACL_COMPACT_FMT | ACL_APPEND_ID | ACL_SID_FMT);

	to save space in order to be able to hold more ACL entries in a
	single 512 byte block. This change actually permits most files to have
	all meta data inside a single 512 byte block with extended TAR data.

-	star: star.1 Now uses 4-digit year numbers for the last changed date

-	star: star.4 Now uses 4-digit year numbers for the last changed date

-	star: star.4 documents the new ACL format for NFSv4 ACLs.

-	SCCS: "sccs help" now includes a short help for
	"add", "commit", "remove", "rename", "status"

	The commands: "commit", "remove", "rename", "status" still do not work.

-	SCCS: get no longer dumps core when it is told to retrieve more than
	one annotated file (using -A) at a time. The bug was caused by calling
	ffreeall() that freed up the user name cache as well, but did not NULL
	out the pointer to the name hash table at the same time.

-	SCCS: sccs no longer dumps core when calling "sccs -R unedit" and more
	than a single file is affected. The reason was a misplaced bracket while
	computing the number of bytes needed for the path name of the current
	file.


-	strar: Not yet ready, the current status is:

	This command is usable for basic work already The following features
	are currently missing:

	-	A method to descend directory trees, e.g. libfind

	-	A noclobber flag

	-	A method to avoid to replace files that are more recent on
		disk than in the archive.

	-	Set the file permissions

	-	Set the original file time stamps

	-	Set the original file owners.

	These features will be implemented in a future version.




-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
