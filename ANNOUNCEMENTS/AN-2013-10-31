New features with AN-2013-10-31:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

	Added uname.c to the list of files to be compiled.

-	include/schily/windows.h now includes the same type workaround
	for MINGW32 as fir the Microsoft C compiler, as there are the same

	Thanks for Daniel Pielmeier from Gentoo for reporting and testing.

-	New functions in libschily:

	absfpath()
	resolvefpath()

	allow to better control the behavior using flags.
