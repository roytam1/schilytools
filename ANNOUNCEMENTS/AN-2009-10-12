New features with AN-2009-10-99:

-	Added support for 64 bit compilation on HP-HX using "cc".
	Use make CCOM=cc64 as usual to switch to 64 bit compilation.

-	Make libscg deal with the new error code from HP-UX that
	is returned for a non-existing ATAPI slave.

-	Some minor changes in libscg to make scgcheck report less problems
	with HP-UX

-	libschily/fconv.c reworked to deal with non-C99 compliant systems and to deal
	with the constraints found in HP-UX-11.11. There is now a local implementation
	for isinf()/isnan() that works for IEEE floating point implementations.

-	Avoid an error on HP-UX "address of register requested" that preventd
	to compile the SCCS program subsystem.

-	New file mkisofs/rock.h 

-	isodump now prints more information about Rock Ridge attributes to
	help debugging non-compliant Rock Ridge ISO images.

-	mkisofs and isoinfo now correctly identify ISO images made with the Mac OS X
	program "hdiutil" by e.g. calling:

	hdiutil makehybrid -iso -hfs -verbose -o xxx.iso some_dir

	As filesystems that violate the Rock Ridge standard.

	Check e.g. by "isoinfo -i xxx.iso -d"

	Interpreting Rock Ridge on such images can be enforced by calling:

	"isoinfo -i xxx.iso -lR -debug" 

-	The cdrecord man page has been restructured.

-	The cdda2wav man page has been restructured.

-	A lot of restructuring and rewriting in the mkisofs man page.

-	Fixed a bug in the workaround code for a firmware bug for DVD+R
	media in HL-DT-ST drives.

-	Bumped cdrtools to 2.01.01a66
