New features with AN-2014-05-05:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!


-	config.guess now understands Mac OS X on 64 bit Intel

-	libschily/mknodat.c now correctly provides a mknodat() function even
	when there is no mknod() command.

-	libschily/futimens.c now is more Sun specific when trying to implement
	futimens() via utimensat(), as only Solaris supports a f*() interface
	in case that the path name is a NULL pointer.

-	libschily/fchmodat.c was added, it has been forgotten when
	the emulations for the *at() functions have been introdiced.
	It ne needed for the new enhanced isoinfo command.


-	A few minor corrections in the Bourne Shell to avoid GCC warnings
	that have been observed on the limited (SunOS-5) version of the
	Shell that is installed as "osh".

-	The man page isoinfo.8 was enhanced by mentioning the option -s (print
	file sizes in multiple if 2048 byte sectors) and by documenting the 
	list format that us used with -l.

-	isoinfo now evaluates the Rock Ridge "PN" signature and thus supports
	to display and use the major/minor device numbers.

-	isoinfo now extracts time stamps with sub second granularity in 
	order to be able to set fine grained file timestamps, see -X option
	below.

-	isoinfo now knows how to find out whether a ISO-9660 filesystem was
	created by a newer mkisofs and thus includes useful inode numbers
	in ISO-9660. These ISO-9660 based inode numbers are used in case that
	there is no Rock Ridge-1.12 that includes inode numbers in the "PX"
	signature.

-	isoinfo now has a new option -X that extracts alls files (in case that
	-find is not used) or files secected by a -find expression. Note that
	-find expressions may include -chown, -chgrp and -chmod to modify the
	meta data of files.
