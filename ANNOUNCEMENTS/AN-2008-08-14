New features with AN-2008-08-14:

-	New directory autoconf/ contains the complete Schily autoconf system.
	It is based on GNU autoconf-2.13, the latest GNU autoconf that worked
	correctly even on older systems.

-	Sources and makefilesystem restructured to allow all needed files to be
	retrieved from the SCCS repository and to call "make" later. To achieve
	this, all symlinks have been removed from the tarball.

-	The Schily Makefile System now includes rules to recreate the file
	"configure" by calling "autoconf". This is needed in order to allow the 
	complete source tree to be extracted from the SCCS repository.

-	New autoconf test AC_CHECK_DLIB() checks for lib members while using
	specified include files. This is a workaround for the autoconf hostile
	gettext() and iconv() implementations on Linux.

-	The gettext()/iconv() tests have been rewritten to use AC_CHECK_DLIB()

-	The autoconf test AC_FUNC_VFORK from Paul Eggert was not written in
	clean C and thus failed on a ANSI-C compiler, asuming that vfork()
	is not available in the ANSI case.

-	README.compile fixed to refer to READMEs/README.gmake instead of 
	README.gmake

-	Symlink support in RULES/MKLINKS added for ia64-hp-ux-cc.rul and
	ia64-hp-ux-gcc.rul, thanks to a hint from Steven M. Schweda
-	Added a workaround for a GNU make design bug that causes the rules
	to create file "foo" to be evaluated _past_ the "include foo"
	statement in a Makefile has been evaluated. Note that you still need 
	GNU make 3.81. GNU make 3.80 and before will still fail to compile 
	cdrtools because of other unfixed GNU make bugs.

	Note that the basic GNU make design bug has been reported to the 
	GNU make maintainers and accepted as bug by the GNU make maintainers
	in 1998 already. It is still unfixed in GNU make although smake and
	SunPro make verify that there is no problem to do it right.

-	Added a workaround for the GNU make workaround into smake.
	The GNU make workaround requires to create an otherwise useless 
	dependency from one include file to another previously included file
	to make GNU make believe that a rule to make the file exists at all.
	As smake resets the state of all included targets after including them,
	in order to force the re-evaluation of the complete rule set after
	all  makefiles have been read, smake believed that the second file
	did not exist because it depends on a "non-existent" file and called
	the .INCLUDE_FILED: rule.

	Smake now checks the file for existence before deciding whether to call
	the .INCLUDE_FILED: rule.

-	psmake/ scripts now auto-create the symlinks or copies to the original
	source files.

-	psmake/MAKE-sh now aborts before compilation if "configure" does
	not create xconfig.h (e.g. because the installed compiler is defective).

-	aspi-win32.h and spti-wnt.h now in SCCS

-	fixed a bug in star that caused star to print the list output
	on stderr if the archive was read from stdin.

-	New link "jsh" (job control shell) to "sh"

-	Fixed a bug in the Bourne shell child handling introduced in
	February 2008 when trying to fix a hang from ^Z on FreeBSD.
	The Bourne Shell now no longer leaves zombies around.

-	the file bsh/pfexec.c now always includes an exported function pfinit()

-	New cdda2wav option -no-fork tells cdda2wav to run in unbuffered mode.

-	New cdda2wav option -interactive 

	The first test implemenation supports the following interactive commands:

	stop	stop reading

		If you like to empty the internal buffers,
		send "stop" read everything you get from the output pipe
		repeat this until no further data is available.

	cont	continue reading

	read trasks <trackno>	Start reading from new trackno

	read sectors <secno>	Start reading from new sector number

	exit
	quit	exit cdda2wav


	This new option is a result from a collaboration with the GNOME
	developers to make "sound-juicer" legal. Sound-juicer suffers from
	license problems from libcdio which is usually loaded as a 
	"gstreamer" plugin.

	The option -interactive together with the related new libgstcdda2wavsrc
	gives better quality of the extracted audio-data and does not cause license
	violations.

-	Cdda2wav child_pid variable moved into gloval var structure.

-	The new -interactive option has now been stabilized for a first integration that
	allows to replace libcdio for sound-juicer to come to an implementation without
	license violations.

-	Reduced the minimal cdrecord write speed of a ultraspeed CD-RW 
	capable drive from 16x to 10x.

-	Try to avoid mkisofs inconsistencies with USE_LARGEFILES with 
	multi-extent files

-	Corrected the mkisofs iso directory record size computation in
	stream-file mode

-	Mkisofs no longer tries to write 8 TB of data in case that 
	-stream-media-size was too small.

-	Mkisofs now correctly limits filenames with non-ISO-8859-1 characters
	to 127 chars max.

-	Mkisofs now correctly sets the permissions for "invented" unreal
	directories in UDF instread of using mode 000.

-	cdrtools version bumped to 2.01.01a46

-	smake version bumped to 1.2a43
