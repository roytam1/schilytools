New features with AN-2015-09-16:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	The file BOOTSTRAP has been updated to mention how to manually
	bootstrap when there is no gmake program.

-	The top level Makefile was renamed to "SMakefile", the top level
	GNUmakefile was renamed to "Makefile". This helps to automate
	the bootstrap process to deal with other make implementations that
	do not support the schily makefilesystem. in special, this helps
	to automate the bootstrap process on *BSD systems.

-	A autoconf test that caused a hang on newer Cygwin versions has been
	disabled as it seems that Cygwin is unmantained and does not fix
	bugs even within several years.

-	SCCS was bumped to version 5.08

-	*************** Warning for NetBSD users:

	NetBSD has a   typedef int idtype_t   in /usr/include/types.h

	This typedef is not needed in NetBSD (accurding to the NetBSD folks)
	and it is in conflict with the POSIX standard. If you like to compile
	schily tools, first remove that definition from /usr/include/types.h
	before you compile (automatically run "configure" from the makefiles).
	If you did already call "make" before you correct your system,
	call:
		./.clean

	and try again.

	The POSIX standard requires idtype_t to be an enumeration type that
	includes at least:

		P_ALL
		P_PGID
		P_PID

	****************************************************************

-	cdda2wav: fixed the file setuid.c to work on NetBSD. Thanks to
	Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: the trap command is now POSIX compliant and prints the
	list of the current trap definitions the way POSIX defines.

-	Bourne Shell: A bug with shell variable handling caused by vfork()
	has been fixed. The command "ZZZ=aaa ls" will no longer leave ZZZ=aaa
	in the main shell process.

-	Bourne Shell: Now only parameter assignements that precede 
	special builtins result in an effect in the main shell process.
	For other builtin commands, the results are reverted after calling
	the related builtin command.

-	Bourne Shell: the alias/builtin/map/pushd/popd/umask/unalias commands
	no longer exit a shell script if called with incorrect syntax or
	fatal errors. The original implementation copied behavior from
	other shell builtins and thus followed the original Bourne Shell
	behavior instead of trying to be compatible to the new POSIX
	rule not to exit the shell in case of non-special builtins. 

-	Bourne Shell: test.c may now be compiled POSIX compliant with
	-DDO_POSIX_FAILURE

-	Bourne Shell: hash builtin may now be compiled POSIX compliant with
	-DDO_POSIX_FAILURE

-	Bourne Shell: read builtin may now be compiled POSIX compliant with
	-DDO_POSIX_FAILURE

-	Bourne Shell: bg/fg/jobs/kill/killpg/pgrp/stop/suspend
	builtins may now be compiled POSIX compliant with -DDO_POSIX_FAILURE

-	Bourne Shell: cd/chdir/dirs/pwd
	builtins may now be compiled POSIX compliant with -DDO_POSIX_FAILURE

-	Borne Shell: Support for the POSIX variable PPID= was added.

-	Borne Shell: First hacky support for the POSIX variable LINENO= was
	added. Note that this currently does not yet work for "dosh", "eval"
	functions and the "." builtin command.

-	libfind no longer uses gettext() but dgettext() and thus no longer
	destroys the message binding from the Bourne Shell

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
