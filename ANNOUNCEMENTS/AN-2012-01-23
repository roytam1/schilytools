New features with AN-2011-11-99:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Schily.Copyright file updated

-	Added links for:

	amd64-freebsd-cc.rul
	amd64-freebsd-gcc.rul

	amd64-openbsd-cc.rul
	amd64-openbsd-gcc.rul

	x86_64-darwin-cc.rul
	x86_64-darwin-gcc.rul
	x86_64-darwin-cc64.rul
	x86_64-darwin-gcc64.rul
	x86_64-darwin-cc32.rul
	x86_64-darwin-gcc32.rul

-	RULES/rules.loc now makes $(PTARGET) to depend on $(ARCHDIR) to 
	support make -j 2

-	New include files include/schily/inttypes.h and include/schily/stdint.h

-	The script conf/makeinc is no longer confused by OpenBSD
	that has man.7 and mandoc.7 and both match on man*


-	A workaround for a bug in llvm-gcc-4.2 has been introduced in
	inc/avoffset.c. The llvm-gcc-4.2 bug caused an endless loop at an
	unexpected place.

-	New autoconf tests for getdelim() and strncasecmp()

-	New functions strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() for libschily.

-	New functions diropen() dirrdopen() dirclose() for libschily.
	These functions are needed in order to emulate fchdir() on platforms
	that do not support fchdir().

-	The function defltcntl() in libdeflt is now working and allows to
	select a case insensitive mode.

-	New function defltsect() in libdeflt allows to create sub-sections
	in configuration files. These subsections need to be named:
	"[section-name]" and the '[' must be at the beginning of a line.

-	Added a workaround fot a auto-dependency creation bug in the HP-UX
	c-compiler that resulted in wrong dependency files for all files
	in libshcily/stdio/ and for these files prevented an automated
	recompilation in case that an include file was changed.

-	smake::job.c is now delivered.

-	smake no longer core dumps on read errors for makefiles but disables
	the software signal "file_read_err" and catches the error.

-	The files cpfiles, lnfiles, rmfiles and MAKE-sh have been 
	enhanced by file_raise.c that is needed for the change above.

-	Fixed a typo in the smake man page

-	Some of the SCCS error messages are now enhanced by errno related
	text to make debugging easier. This in special includes messages
	related to lock-file creation.

-	SCCSv6 now creates at least 13 bytes of hexadecimal urandom data
	for new files. This results in a constant string length until year 2146.

-	Added a first version of the changeset.4 man page for SCCSv6

-	rename the bsh derived freetree() function in libshedit to
	shell_freetree() in order to avoid name conflicts with the Bourne Shell
	freetree() function.

-	Try to make star immune against signals that appear while opening a 
	file from a network filesystem.

-	Let the star FIFO better handle the media change operation at the end of
	a tape volume in multi volume create mode.

-	Allow star to auto-detect the "EOF" condition on a raw disk when writing
	in multi volume create mode. ENXIO has been added as an alias for EFBIG
	and ENOSPC.

-	The star.4 manpage was enhanced.

-	star_sym.c now uses O_SEARCH for opening directories.
