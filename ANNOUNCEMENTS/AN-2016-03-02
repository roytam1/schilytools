New features with AN-2016-03-02:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	README.compile now mentions clang

-	libschily: getargs.c has been fixed. The bug was introduced when trying
	to fix a coredump in January 2014 that was a result from the enhancements
	made in summer 2007 to support mkisofs. The bug introduced in 2014 caused
	our od(1) that is based on hdump(1) to ignore combinations of single char
	flags, e.g. with "od -bc ...".

-	libshedit added another workaround to prevent problems with stdio.h
	This is needed with clang under Solaris as clang defines _XOPEN_SOURCE 600
	by default

-	ved/ttycmds.c now #undef's CS because clang under Solaris includes
	sys/regset.h by default and that includes a #define CS 15

-	cdda2wav: Many small rewrites from Heiko Eißfeldt, mainly to reduce the
	scope of variables and to correctly use the "%u" printf format for
	unsigned variables.

-	Bourne Shell: Empty commands in the form: ";" or ";echo" are now allowed.
	This makes behavior a bit more orthogonal, as sh -c '' did always work,
	but sh -c ';' did not.

-	Bourne Shell: A bug fix for a $(...) command substitution was added where
	the problem was caused by a global variable and a recursive call to the
	parser. The related shell script was seen on the dash mailing list:

		http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.comp.shells.dash/1241


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Arithmetic Substitution with $((expression))

	- Do not list functions when calling "set" with no arguments.
	  Note that this POSIX requirement is seen as a POSIX bug as there
	  is no POSIX command to list function definitions.
	  NOTE that this will not be implemented before POSIX bug
	  http://austingroupbugs.net/view.php?id=1025 was fixed.


	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be SUSv8)

	We are getting very close to full POSIX support.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
