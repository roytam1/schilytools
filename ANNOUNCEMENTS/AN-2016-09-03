New features with AN-2016-09-03:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Star: The man page now includes a link to the star sources.

-	Star: Add support for NFSv4 ACLs on FreeBSD based on a patch from
	Martin Matuska <martin@matuska.org>

-	Bourne Shell: Print PS4 before a variable assignment when in "set -x"
	mode.

-	Bourne Shell: Try to avoid some casting in the parser that may cause
	problems with strict aliasing in GCC.
	Thanks to Martin Väth <martin@mvath.de> for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: PS1, PS2, and PS4 are now subject to macro expansion
	before they are used.

-	Bourne Shell: a new option "set -o promptcmdsubst" allows to switch
	on command substitution and arithmetic substitution for PS1, PS2,
	and PS4. POSIX does not require this, but other shells do this even
	though it is seen as a seurity risk. To avoid the security problem
	from importing PS1, PS2, and PS4 from the environment, the shell
	resets PS1, PS2, and PS4 to the default values when "promptcmdsubst"
	is turned on.

-	Bourne Shell: The lexer now consumes the whole string from a multi-byte
	character string from readw() before calling chkpr() as chkpr() now may
	cause macro expansion that resets the return string from readw().

-	Bourne Shell: The lexer no longer translates '\nfoo' into \\n\f\o\o but
	into "\n"\f\o\o in order to allow to pass the string through the parser
	more than once as needed with $(cmd).

-	Bourne Shell: Better comment and indentation for mode.h

-	Bourne Shell: Copy only as many bytes as the real structure size 
	when copying struct comnod and struct lstnod.

-	Bourne Shell: New debug code for DOL_PAREN_DEBUG and MATCH_BLOCK_DEBUG

-	Bourne Shell: popd now always prints the new directory

-	bsh: popd now always prints the new directory

-	bsh: Fixed a typo in the "popd" usage text

-	Bourne Shell: A new tar archive dotfiles.tar.bz2 has been added that
	contains sample dotfiles for the Bourne Shell. This includes the files:

	.bshmap		The mapping definitions for the history editor

	.globals	The file containing persistent alias definitions

	.shrc		The file that is read by every interactive Bourne Shell

	.termcap	Local termcap definitions read before /etc/termcap


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
