New features with AN-2008-01-02:

-	The function getperm() has been moved from libfind to libschily

-	The file streams packet has been added to libschily

-	star's new function samefile() has been fixed to avoid a core
	dump with "star -ctv"

-	star_sym and all SCCS commands are now linked against  $(LIB_INTL)
	to allow a compilation on platforms like Mac OS X where gettext()
	is not in libc. Thanks to Tatjana Heuser for reporting

-	Correctly use strsignal() on Mac OS X in sccs.c 
	Thanks to Tatjana Heuser for reporting

-	New autoconf test HAVE_SYS_SIGLIST_DEF checks for sys_siglist[]
	definition in signal.h Thanks to Tatjana Heuser for reporting

-	Possibly double #defines HAVE_ICONV HAVE_ICONV_OPEN HAVE_ICONV_CLOSE
	in include/schily/iconv.h fixed. Thanks to Tatjana Heuser for reporting

-	cdrecord now implements a simulated "blank" feature for media that
	itself does not support blanking: currently DVD-RAM + DVD+RW
