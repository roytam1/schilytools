New features with AN-2014-04-22:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


-	i86pc-sunos5-clang.rul now contains a working set of options
	to create shared libraries using clang.

-	New symlink RULES/x86_64-linux-clang.rul to support non
	automake-enabled make programs like gmake.

-	~/.termcap has been updated in ved/dotfiles.tar.bz2 to match the
	~/.termcap file in bsh/dotfiles.tar.bz2

-	ved/map.c updated to the same version that is used by bsh

-	libschily/fstream.c now supports local flags (for the caller)
	and pushable streams to keep blocks of pushed text atomically.

-	Fixed a typo in the online help from bsh::alias

-	bsh now correctly handles begin aliases even when they appear after
	a leading I/O directive.

-	bsh now handles begin aliases that end in space or TAB and re-enables
	begin aliases for the text that is read after the alias replacement
	text has been consumed.

-	bsh now correctly handles "$@" as "$1" "$2" ...

-	.globals in bsh/dotfiles.tar.bz2 has been updated to match the new alias
	rules that are common to the bsh and the Bourne Shell

-	bsh now also sets PWD= when changing a directory. Previously, only CWD=
	was updated, but Bourne Shell compatibility needs PWD=

-	The previous bsh option -o has been renamed to "-noclose".

-	bsh now supports the option -o in a way that is compatible to ksh and the
	Bourne Shell

-	bsh now supports the option -o aliasowner=user as the Bourne Shell does.
	This allows to set up a common su alias for both bsh and sh:

		alias 'su=su $SHELL -o aliasowner=$LOGNAME'

	to let the root shell use the aliases from the user that called su.

-	A bug in the Bourne Shell that could cause the shell to die when calling
	"set -o aliasowner" has been fixed.

-	The Bourne now correctly handles begin aliases that end in space or TAB
	and re-enables begin aliases for the text that is read after the alias
	replacement text has been consumed.

-	The Bourne Shell now correctly disables the "interactive" state while
	reading the files /etc/sh.shrc and $HOME/.shrc
	This is needed to have the right number of prompts when the history
	editor is disabled.

-	Add several new #ifdef's to the Bourne Shell to better tailor enhancements.

-	A "new" variant of the Bourne Shell is available under the name "osh".
	This version of the Bourne Shell is still highly portable as it includes
	the conversion from sbrk() to malloc(), but it has been compiled in a way
	that does not include the Schily enhancements.

	-	The history editor and the commands: history / map / savehistory
		are disabled.
		The editor is enabled with -DINTERACTIVE

	-	The alias support and the commands: alias / unalias
		are disabled.
		Aliases are anabled with -DDO_SYSALIAS

	-	Parsing commands like:

			var2=val2 var1=val1 command....

		is done in the unexpected reversed order for var2=val2 var1=val1
		like on SVr4 and SunOS.
		Historic behavior is enabled with -DARGS_RIGHT_TO_LEFT

	-	The builtin command: alloc
		is not enabled.
		The alloc builtin is enabled with -DDO_SYSALLOC

	-	The rcfiles /etc/sh.shrc and $HOME/.shrc
		are not read. This also disables the special
		meaning of the ENV= environment.
		The shell rcfiles are enabled with -DDO_SHRCFILES

	-	The builtin command: repeat
		is not enabled.
		The repeat builtin is enabled with -DDO_SYSREPEAT

	-	The builtin command: dosh
		is not enabled.
		The dosh builtin is enabled with -DDO_SYSDOSH

	-	The builtin commands: pushd / popd / dirs and cd -
		are not enabled.
		The environment variable OLDPWD= is also disabled.
		These builtins are enabled with -DDO_SYSPUSHD

	-	The support for the option -r in the builtin "read"
		is not enabled.
		Support for read -r is enabled with -DDO_READ_R

	-	The support for the option -o in the builtin "set"
		is not enabled.
		Support for set -o is enabled with -DDO_SET_O

	-	The support for the option -S in the builtin "umask"
		is not enabled.
		Support for umask -S is enabled with -DDO_UMASK_S

	-	The support for the POSIX "for i; do ... done" with
		semicolon is not enabled.
		Support for for i; do ... is enabled with -DDO_POSIX_FOR

	-	The bugfix for set -a; read VAR is not included and
		environment variables defined by read are not exported.
		Support for read -a; read VAR is enabled with -DDO_READ_ALLEXPORT

	The following enhanced features of this Bourne Shell variant are 
	not disabled in the old shell mode:

		-version/--version/-V	is always available

		pfexec			implemented in the safe Schily variant
					instead of the problematic Sun variant.

		ulimit			still also implements the -l -m -u
					options

		The SVR4.0 colon (null command) redirection bug is
		always fixed

		The var=none;echo ${var-'$'} SVr3 bug is always fixed

		The "type" command with functions with case statements always
		prints correct code.

		The "times" output format is always POSIXly correct.

		Reading/execcuting shell scripts never tries to catch a
		directory with the name of the expected script.
