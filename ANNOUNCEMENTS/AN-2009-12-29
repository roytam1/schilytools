New features with AN-2009-12-29:

-	libxtermcap/tgetent.c:
	smake/make.c:
	lndir/lndir.c:
	sformat/datio.c:
	ved/tags.c:
	bsh/inputc.c:
	Do no longer shorten strings using strcpy()/wcscpy() as newer POSIX
	versions claim that overlapping buffers cause undefined 
	results and as the Solaris 64 bit libc starting with Build 125, 
	implements strcpy() using SSE instructions and thus fails with
	overlapping strings.

-	conf/src-get now includes $SRCROOT/conf in PATH to allow to find
	"src-get" for recursive calls.

-	conf/mkdir.sh now includes a workaround for a problem with 
	/us/xpg4/bin/sed on Solaris.

-	Fixed a bug smake that has been introduced while trying to avoid
	a core dump with some strange Makefiles.

	smake now again tolerates:

	target: deplist
	<TAB>cmd1
	<TAB>
	target2: deplist2

-	smake now supports an undocumented feature of UNIX make that allows
	to specify:

	$(EMPTY): deplist

-	"sccs log" now avoids a core dump if called with the SCCS history from
	BSD-4.4 on the CSRG CD CSRG_Archive_4 as this CD contains corrupt
	SCCS history files. The core dump happened with calling: "sccs -R log"

-	cdrecord man page enhanced

-	cdda2wav man page enhanced

-	Cdrecord now sets the default write mode to -sao if called:
	cdrecord cuefile=xxx

-	The default outout format for cdda2wav is now .wav for all platforms.
	Before, the default for Solaris was .au.

-	cdrtools bumped to 2.01.01a70
