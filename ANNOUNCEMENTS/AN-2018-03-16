New features with AN-2018-03-16:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	configure: A test for SELinux has been added

-	libsiconv: The configuration files have been moved from the directory
	$INS_BASE/lib/siconv/ to $INS_BASE/share/lib/siconv/

	Thanks to Adam Majer <amajer@suse.de> for reporting.

-	smake: When a default command for an implicit target is executed,
	the result is now searched for in the list of object directories.
	This allows to use the current smake again with older versions
	of the schily makefilesystem where the include directives for
	auto-dependency files are not using "-include" but "include".

-	smake: The default rules have been moved from $INS_BASE/lib/defaults.smk
	to $INS_BASE/share/lib/smake/defaults.smk

-	SCCS the sccsdiffs script now uses s.*|*/s.*) instead of *s.*)
	in order to avoid to incorrectly look at files that just have
	a "s" before a dot, but are not SCCS files.

-	SCCS sources: fixed a typo in the CCDL header

-	SCCS man pages: fixed a typo in the CCDL header

-	star: we now add a null byte past a possible tar checksum in the first
	header while trying to find out which archive type is in use.

	This avoids useless warnings: "WARNING: Unterminated octal number at..."
	with cpio archives. The bug and the message have been introduced in
	July 2016.

-	star: 64 new unit tests for archive autodetection have been added

-	star: star_fat.mk has been enhanced to import newer content from
	Makefile

-	star: star.mk has been enhanced to import newer content from
	Makefile

-	star: cpiohdr.c and the star man page have been modified to explain
	that the CPIO CRC archive format uses a 32-bit checksum and no CRC.

-	Bourne Shell: "command set +o invalid" no longer sets $@ to "invalid".

	Thanks to Martijn Dekker for reporting

-	Bourne Shell unit tests: added a test for the bugfix above

-	Bourne Shell: The parameter substitution with prefix and suffix removal
	does now better deal with double quote characters in the pattern
	section.

	Thanks to Martijn Dekker for reporting

-	Bourne Shell unit tests: added a test for the bugfix above

-	Bourne Shell: The "repeat" builtin command change from 2018-03-01
	was not sufficient. We now abort the repeat command as well in case
	that a repeated command terminates with a non-zero exit code.

-	Bourne Shell: 

	bosh -c 'umask 0400; cat << EOF
	test
	EOF'

	did result in a "temp file cannot open" message and a left over
	temp file.

	-	We now call fchmod(fd, 0600) for all temp files to make
		all temp files usable for internal purposes.

	-	We no longer close the expanded copy of the temp file
		and immediately reopen it but rather keep it open.

	Thanks to a hint from Stephane Chazelas <stephane.chazelas@gmail.com>
	to:
	https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/429285/cannot-create-temp-file-for-here-document-permission-denied

-	Bourne Shell unit tests: added a test for the bugfix above

-	Bourne Shell: some minor speedup in stak.c

-	Bourne Shell: some minor speedup in word.c (nextwc()/readwc())

-	Bourne Shell: some speedup in lookup() (aprox. 3% for the whole shell)

-	Bourne Shell man pages: fixed a typo in the CCDL header

-	SunPro Make: Do not longer dump core when MAKEFLAGS ends with a backslash.

-	SunPro Make: fixed a printf format to honor that hostid is a long int.

-	SunPro Make: Make directives are now handled in a more clever way.
	This would make it easier to add more directives later.

-	SunPro Make man pages: fixed a typo in the CCDL header

-	SunPro Make sources: modified sources are not CDDL Version 1.0 only

-	mkisofs: When mkisofs was converted from gnu getopt_long() to getargs()
	in September 2006, the option -chrp-boot was incorrectly marked as option
	_with_ argument.

	Thanks to Adam Majer <amajer@suse.de> for reporting.

-	mkisofs man page: fixed a typo that made the option name -chrp-boot
	unreadable.

-	mkisofs man page: Several tagged paragraphs did not have the hanigng
	text in bold.

-	mkisofs: The siconv configuration files have been moved from the
	directory $INS_BASE/lib/siconv/ to $INS_BASE/share/lib/siconv/


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
