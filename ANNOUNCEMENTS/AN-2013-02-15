New features with AN-2013-02-15:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Fixed a problem in star with "star --xattr -find relative_path ..."
	Thanks to Philip Spencer <pspencer@fields.utoronto.ca> for the patch.

-	cdda2wav now only prints "load cdrom please and press enter" once
	per line and does not repeat the text for garbage characters that
	have been in stdin. Thanks to Phi Tran from Oracle for reporting.

-	mkisofs now reserves more space for the file names to avoid a
	path buffer overrun

-	Fixed a bug in mkisofs that caused to put more than one UDF direcory
	entry for a file in case that the file is a ISO-0660 multi-segment file.

-	Fixed a bug in mkisofs that caused the wrong start sector address to
	be used for UDF in case that the file is a ISO-9660 multi-segment file
	and the -sort option was used.

-	avoid a GCC warning when compiling readcd.c

-	libschily::fexecv() now allows to use the parameter "ac" with the
	value -1 to indicate that the arg count is to be determined by the
	NULL pointer at the end of the arg list.

-	smake bumped to version 1.2.3

-	avoid a false GCC warning when compiling the termcap program

-	The man page sccsfile.4 has been rewritten to make it easier to
	understand.

-	include/schily/stat.h now contains macros to set the nanoseconds
	in timestamps in a OS independent way

-	cdrtools bumped to version 3.01a12

cdrtools changes since 3.01a12:

-	mkisofs now identifies itdelf by default (inside the APPID string)
	as being UDF capable.

-	mkisofs now sets link count and "unique id" == inode number for files.
	Note that this may still not result in useful hardlinked files on all
	platforms as e.g. Solaris and Linux ignore the UDF unique ID and rather
	use the location of the file_entry as inode number. This will never
	return the same number for different filenames that point to the
	same file data and thus prevents hard linked files from being visible.

	This is however not a Solaris problem, the problem is rather in the
	UDF standard that does not require the unique id to be in a 32 bit
	range as long as the media size is = 8 TB. Note that 32 bit UNIX
	programs cannot access files with an inode number that cannot be
	expressed as 32 bit number, so inode numbers that do not fit into
	32 bits may cause problems. Ths only way to work around this problem
	would be to enance the Solaris and Linux UDF filesystem module to
	recognize whether a filesystem has been created by mkisofs that grants
	useful inode numbers. The same is already done for ISO-9660.

-	mkisofs now supports additional file types with UDF:

	-	named pipes
	-	sockets
	-	character devices
	-	block devices

-	mkisofs now supports all three UNIX times with microsecond granularity in UDF

-	mkisofs now sets correct user/group/permission for symlinks in UDF

-	mkisofs now supports S_ISUID, S_ISGID, S_ISVTX (set uid, set gid, sticky) in UDF
