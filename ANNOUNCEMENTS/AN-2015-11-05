New features with AN-2015-11-05:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	Added an autoconf test for tcgetsid()

-	As the defective typedef for idtype_t is already in NetBSD-5,
	we added a workaround based on a new related autoconf test.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	Added support to compile on "Bitrig", an OpenBSD fork for non
	automake aware make implementations like gmake.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	libparanoia: Make abs() a self defined macro as ISO-C defines abs()
	to be a function with int parameter.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	libparanoia: work around a bug that resulted from uninitalized 
	statistics data for C2 checks in case that C2 checking was disabled.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	libscg: added a new error code to make search for the right
	device node work again with newer OpenBSD versions.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt.

-	Cdrtools: version.h now mentions release 3.02a01

-	Cdrecord: man page now explains that Solaris privileges and Linux
	capabilities allow a root-less installation.

-	Cdrecord/Cdda2wav/readcd: The man page now mentions the SCSI CAM 
	standard for dev=

-	cdda2wav: Comparison of function name with NULL replaced with
	comparison of function pointer with NULL.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	cdda2wav: Do no longer initialize the sound card from the main process
	as pulseaudio does not follow UNIX rules for forked processes.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt.

-	cdda2wav: Fixed a bug in the DMA residual computation for the C2 read
	functions where a wrong divisor (2353 instead of 2646) was used.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	cdda2wav: Heiko made the audio output work on OpenBSD

-	cdda2wav: Heiko added code for pulseaudio support in Linux

-	cdda2wav: Fixed a typo ("KHz" -> "kHz")

-	cdda2wav: fixed a problem related to position differences between
	the CD extract part and the filesystemwrite part.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt.

-	cdda2wav: We now include "c2check" in the paranoia mode "proof"
	again and fallback to a non-C2 mode in case the drive does not
	support C2checks.

-	mkisofs: HFS creation: fixed comparison of array with 0 to become
	comparison of array value with 0.

-	smake: Make the code a bit worse to avoid a clang warning where clang
	tries to be foxier than it is.

-	SCCS: the command prs(1) again compiles with smake COPTX=-DGMT_TIME
	Note that GMT_TIME is a hack from Sun that is no longer needed with
	the SCCSv6 history format as the SCCSv6 history format archives the
	local time + GMT offset instead of an untagged local time.
	Thanks to a hint from: Bruce Lilly <bruce.lilly@gmail.com>

-	SCCS: the library function dodelt() no longer warns:

		"Time stamp later than current clock time (co10)\n"

	when SCCS was compiled with smake COPTX=-DGMT_TIME

-	SCCS: get(1) now includes specific code for smake COPTX=-DGMT_TIME 
	but this is probably the last change related to this deprecated
	compile time option.

-	SCCS: add sccs/README.SCCS and include information about compile time
	options.

-	SCCS: some man pages now mention the TZ environemt variable.

-	libfind: find -mtime +2s -mtime +20s now works, as file timestamps
	are now compared to the current time. Before, the current time +60s
	was used - a timestamp that is needed for switching between both 
	time stamp variants for -ls.

-	Bourne Shell: jobs.c avoid si.si_utime/si.si_stime as FreeBSD
	does not implement this SVr4 feature.

-	Bourne Shell: jobs.c do not try to call nice() on platforms where
	nice() does not exist (e.g. Haiku).

-	Bourne Shell: Added experimental code that allows to redefine the
	buffer size used by the internal file I/O buffering.

-	Bourne Shell: The function readwc() has been slightly reordered to
	make it slightly faster.

-	Bourne Shell: bltin.c now contains comment that marks all POSIX special
	builtins.

-	ved/bsh/Bourne Shell: For terminals that have a TERMCAP entry "kb" (Key
	Backspace) we now by default map the string for that key to DEL.
	This helps to make editing less annoying on IBM-PC based keyboard layouts
	that are in violation with the definition of the features of the 
	backspace control charecter.

-	ved/Bourne Shell: add a list of termcap capabilities that are used for input
	maping to the man page and some hints on how to escape mapping for
	e.g. the "Backspece key" on IBM-PC based keyboard layouts.

-	bsh/Bourne Shell: the hash-command "#l" now includes the alias table name
	('l'-ocal or 'g'-lobal) when the related alias is not from the current
	default. This helps when editing aliases via "#lh aliasname".

-	Bourne Shell: the default alias table for hash-commands is now a global
	symbol to permit the above enhancement.

-	Bourne Shell: the "alias" and "unalias" commands now cause an exit 
	code != 0 in case of the situations that POSIX lists for an exit code
	!= 0.

-	Bourne Shell: A command like sh -c "echo foo |" now prints a
	syntax error message

-	Bourne Shell: when compiled with smake COPTX=-DPARSE_DEBUG, the shell
	now prints all debug messages to stderr.

-	Bourne Shell: the "pgrp" builtin now prints -1 instead of "/" in case the
	terminal process group cannot be determined.

-	Bourne Shell and bsh: pgrp now also prints the tty session group id.

-	Bourne Shell and bsh: pgrp now uses ioctl() to retrieve the tty
	process group id as the POSIX tcgetpgrp() function includes aritifical
	access limitations that would harm the usabiltiy.

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
