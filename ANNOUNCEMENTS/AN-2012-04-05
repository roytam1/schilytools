New features with AN-2012-04-05:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Bourne Shell: Some comments from Geoff Collyer have been added

-	Bourne Shell: Some lint fixes have been applied

-	Bourne Shell: The memory management has been converted from sbrk()
	to malloc() based on the basic ideas from Geoff Collyer to convert
	the Bourne Shell to use malloc() only.
	See: http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/sh.tour.ps and
	http://www.collyer.net/who/geoff/

	The code had to be rewritten to match the changes from the SVr4
	Bourne Shell as the original idea from Geoff Collyer was designed
	for the UNIX V7 Bourne Shell from 1977.

	The integration has been done with friendly permission from
	Geoff Collyer.

The Bourne Shell is in a beta phase as a result from these changes.
Please test the new Bourne Shell and report any problems. The new Bourne Shell
now should be highly portable as all other programs in this suite.
