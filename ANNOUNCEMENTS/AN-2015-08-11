New features with AN-2015-08-11:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	Support for Win-10 when compiling with non automake-aware
	make implementations like "gmake" was added.

-	Cdrtools bumped to version 3.01a31. This is the current release
	candidate for 3.01-final.

-	spaste: The new version outputs an empty line for an empty file
	with spaste -s. This makes it correct with regards to the new
	POSIX text after POSIX Bug 973 was fixed. This change makes spaste
	aligned with other implementations.

-	man2html: This was added to schilytools as the original man2html
	command has a bug with processing sub-sections and as the original
	man2html is completely unmaintained since August 12 1997.

-	man2html: subsections are now handled correctly and may be
	longer than a single character.

-	ved: The man page now starts overview tables with a single space
	in order to avoid them to be converted into headlines by man2html.

-	ved: Makefile.warn now supports all Schily makefile targets and
	no longer aborts by e.g. "make installman"

-	ved: map.c was changed the same way as for bsh/libschedit.

-	libshedit: append_line() was added to the exported functions in order
	to support a new feature in the Bourne Shell: allow to add an alias
	definition to the history to make it editable by the history editor.

-	libshedit: a "fileread()" entry was added. This permits to implement
	optimized reading of the history and cursor mappings from the
	Bourne Shell instead of reading byte-wise as a result of not using
	stdio.

-	bsh/libshedit: map.c was rewritten to read the mapfile with built-in
	buffering.

-	bsh/libshedit: inputc.c was rewritten to read the history file 
	with built-in buffering.

-	bsh: Fixed a memory leak in the hash command interpreter that was
	identified when porting this code to the Bourne Shell.

-	bsh and Bourne Shell: avoiding a coredump from division by zero in
	the '@' builtin that was recently added to the Bourne Shell but
	exists since 30 years in bsh with the same bug.

-	Bourne Shell manpage: better information on how to use the "dosh"
	builtin command (that implements a concept from "bsh") together 
	with aliases in order to create parameterizable aliases.
	Note that parameterizable aliases have been available in bsh since
	1980. Parameterizable aliases are now available in bsh, csh and the
	Bourne Shell, but not in ksh or bash. So have a look at the documentation
	if you did not yet know this unique characteristics in the Bourne Shell.

-	Bourne Shell manpage: Source download URL added

-	Bourne Shell manpage: Better explanation for the unique characteristics
	of the command line history editor.

-	Bourne Shell: Support for the POSIX/ksh PS4 string was added. The PS4
	string permits to control the prefix for "set -x" messages. The PS4
	string is subject to parameter substitution before every use, so it
	may e.g. contain "$$".

-	Bourne Shell: hash commands (a concept from the UNOS command interpreter
	from 1980 and bsh) have been added. This helps to deal with complex aliases
	that would need highly complex quoting when using the alias(1) interface.
	To edit an existing persistent alias in the command line history editor
	do the following:

		set -o hashcmds		# Enable hash commands
		#lh aliasname
		type cursor up key
		edit the alias and hit ENTER
		Now the new alias is in effect.

	Note that enabling hash commands via set(1) -o hashcmds may cause some 
	minor problems with certain comments in shell scripts. For this reason,
	hash commands are turned off by default.

-	Bourne Shell: "set -o hostprompt" allows to set PS1 to automatically
	be "<hostname> <username>> " which is the default prompt used by "bsh"
	since 1985.
	

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
