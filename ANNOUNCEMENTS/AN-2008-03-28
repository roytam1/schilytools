New features with AN-2008-02-23:

-	The shell source for "bsh" has been added. Bsh is one of the very
	"early" shells that started to support a cursor editable history 
	in 1984. It is based on an experimental "shell" from 1982 that
	implemented the history editor already but called the system shell
	via system(3).

-	libshedit new. This is really parts of the "bsh" shell together with
	some wrapper code that allows to use the bsh history editing and
	file name completion code from a shell like the Bourne Shell that
	does not use stdio.

-	The sources for the "Bourne Shell" have been added. The current
	source code is based on OpenSolaris Nevada Build 84. The source has
	been massively reworked (nearly 20% of the code was changed) in
	order to make the code portable and cleanly compile. Several bugs
	have been fixed while making the code portable.

	This version of the Bourne Shell offers interactive history editing
	and file name completion via libshedit.

NOTE: If you see compiler warnings while compiling bsh, sh or libshedit on
Linux, please make a bug report against your Linux distributor. The warnings
are a result of broken/missing definitions in /usr/include/. As these warnings
may prevent a clean compilation on 64 bit systems, it is important to get the
files in /usr/include fixed.....

-	include/schily.h modified to allow to compile "libshedit"

-	libsiconv/sic_nls.c modified to allow compilation with older GCC
	versions.

-	libfind (used by sfind, bsh, star, mkisofs) fixed the -exec {} +
	implementation. Before the fix, it could core dump if the built-in
	xargs(1) would exactly fill up args to the size of ARG_MAX.

-	libxtermcap/tgetent.c made safe against NULL pointers in the
	termcap data buffer

-	Cdrecord compiles again with K&R compiler

-	Mkisofs now gives better warning for files > 4 GB in hope it
	will no direct people to read the documentation.

-	Star compiles again with K&R compiler

-	Star now supports a new diffopts= parameter called "symperm".
	This allows to exclude permission comparison for symlinks.

-	Better portability for SCCS

-	Fixed some very old AT&T bugs (missing 64 bit compliance) in SCCS that 
	are caused by the fact that the last execl*() Parameter was not casted to a
	true (char *)NULL pointer.

-	sccs(1) now correctly used strsignal() if available

-	Correctly cast pid_t to uintmax_t and use %j for portablity .

-	Added a rule to the makefilesystem to auto-create the directory ./incs
	which was the only "empty" directory without creation rule. Thanks to a hint
	from Michael Prokop <mika@grml.org>

-	star -version now prints the compile options. This helps to find out whether
	e.g. ACL support is included. As Linux distributions usually install non
	developer friendly, this is a common problem on Linux.

-	Star has been prepared for a future POSIX.1-2001 extended tar header keyword
	"SCHILY.acl.type" that is needed in future when ZFS ACLs support is added.

-	The suntar ("tar") command line interface now switches to artype=exustar
	if the -p (archive ACLs) option has been specified.

-	Star in incremental dump mode now compares whether info->f_mtime >= Newer.tv_sec
	instead of info->f_mtime > Newer.tv_sec to avoid race conditions. Thanks
	to a hint from Lasse Kliemann.

-	Many new autoconf tests to allow the portable compilation of the Bourne Shell sources.

-	Allow libscg to work correctly on Solaris if compiled on a "amd64" platform.

-	Make printf("%j", ...) work correctly

-	getargs() now first checks the correctness of combined single char options before
	it attempts to assign values.

-	librmt now supports SEEK_DATA and SEEK_HOLE

-	cdrecord now supports a blank= simulation for BluRay media

-	Better rmt(1) man page

-	rmt now always forbids to include "/../" in a path name.
