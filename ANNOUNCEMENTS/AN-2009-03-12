New features with AN-2009-03-12:

-	schily/schily.h now by default includes stdio.h in case that
	the platform defines the POSIX.1-2008 finctions getline() or fgetline()
	that are in conflict with the POSIX standard rules.

	stdio.h is included in order to alow to auto-rename the original
	functions to js_getline() and ls_fgetline() which have been defined ~ 1982.

-	New autoconf test to distinguish between the free of charge 
	"Bundled" cc on HP-UX and the commercial cc. Only the commercial cc 
	supports ANSI C and the Bundled cc complains when the ANSI Options
	are used:

	(Bundled) cc: warning 480: The -A option is available only with the C/ANSI C product; ignored.
	(Bundled) cc: warning 480: The -O option is available only with the C/ANSI C product; ignored.

	These warnings are no longer present.

-	schily/stkframe.h now uses Intptr_t for the fr_savp member to make it
	work correctly on 64bit systems without OS supplied stkframe.h.

-	New autoconf test on whether unistd.h defines extern char ** environ.

-	New file schily/stdio.h to simplify layering.

-	SCCS get.c and sccs.c no longer define "extern int errno" in order to
	avoid conflicts with multi threaded definitions.

-	Minor typo fix in the mkisofs man page

-	Avoid some GCC warnings

-	libschily/format.c now supports the %z (size_t) and %t (ptrdiff_t) 
	printf format size modifiers.

-	Some small typos in cdrecord's error messages have been fixed.

-	Cdrecord added a w orkaround for 'TSSTcorp' 'CDDVDW SE-S224Q ' 'TS01'
	firmware bug. The drives does not return SES_UNDEF for unformatted 
	DVD+RW media.

-	Support again cdrecord -v -sao -multi *.wav
	This stopped working with 2.01.01a29 when introducing DVD multi-border
	support.

-	Added some dependencies for alling MKLINKS in various directories.
	This is needed because GNU make ignores some dependencies and
	evaluates dependencies in the wrong order.

-	New SCSI low level transport for ATARI FreeMiNT has been added.
	This makes the ATARI support complete.
	Thanks to Yvan Doyeux

-	Do not install by overwriting /etc/default/cdrecord in case an earlier file
	exists.

	Please give feedback on what you like to see in future.
	
	Do you like to see a sample file installed?

-	README.cdplus has been renewed 

-	Prevent a core dump from hitting ^C while cdda2wav tries to call
	scg_open() to open the SCSI devices.

-	A buggy address compuation in cdda2wav that caused problems with 64 bit
	binaries has been fixed.

-	Cdda2wav now correctly deals with longer CD-Text information.
	Thanks to Yvan Doyeux for creating a related test CD...

-	struct tocdesc in cdda2wav has been restructured to prevent struct tail 
	padding on MC-680x0 systems.
	Thanks to Yvan Doyeux for reporting this for the ATARI port.

-	The drive 'HP ' 'CD-Writer+ 9600 ' '1.0a' does not like to read SCSI FULL TOC
	with a too long transfer lenght. First retrieve the available data count.

-	New options -debug -debug-scsi -kdebug -kdebug-scsi -kd to set SCSI low level
	debugging in libscg

-	The option -v not also supports "!" and "not" to invert the list
	of "verbose" options (e.g. -v!indices for everything but indices).

-	Some casts have been added to increase the 64 bit compilation support in mkisofs

-	mkisofs and the tools isodump, isovfy and isoinfo now completely
	support the SUSP termination signature "ST".

-	Do no longer flag the absence of a "RR" signature as an error in
	isodump, isovfy and isoinfo as newer Rock Ridge standard versions removed RR.

-	Try to exit(excode) in readcd instead of exit(0)  in case that siginificant
	problems occured.

-	Prevent readcd from dumping core via raisecond("file_write_err")->abort()
	in case that the target filesystem fills up.

-	cdrtools version has been bumped to 2.01.01a58

-	The Bourne Shell has been modified to work under FreeBSD-7.1

-	the portable smake directord "psmake" now created links to schily/stdio.h 
	which is needed on some platforms.

-	New include file include/schily/sysexits.h helps to make things portable to 
	platforms without sysexits.h

-	Added platform support for "Haiku" being a BeOS/Zeta clone.

	The following problems remain wit Haiku and need to be fixed in Haiku:

	-	GNU tar does not unpack our source archive correctly on 
		Haiku. The related GNU tar bug is present since 1993 and
		never has been completely fixed.

		WORKAROUND:
		Use "star" to unpack it.

	-	Calling setbuf(fp, NULL) on Haiku causes the application
		to die from a null function pointer reference inside libc

		WORKAROUND:
		Upgrade to Haiku r29155 (February 8th 2009) or newer.

	-	Calling setbuf(stdout, buf) will cause a libc induced
		buffer overflow in "buf" as libc tries to out more data
		than BUFSIZ into buf.

		WORKAROUND:
		The currently known to be affected program is "p".
		Edit p.c and change the size of "buffer" from BUFSIZE to 8192.
		Recompile p

	-	Calling tcsetpgrp() causes a process to hang infinitely.
		This causes "bsh" to fail on Haiku while "bsh" works
		on Zeta.

		WORKAROUND:
		Edit bsh/Makefile and comment out the followinf line 

		CPPOPTS +=      -DJOBCONTROL            # Include Job Control management

	WARNING: As setbuf() is called by many programs in this source
	tree, other programs are expected to suffer from the setbuf() bugs too.


-	Support for Syllable was added. Syllable is a fork from AtheOS.

-	star_sym no honors the autoconf result HAVE_FCHDIR

-	SCCS admin.c now includes schily/maxpat.h to verify that MAXPATHNAME
	is defined.

-	SCCS diffh.c now works around an incompatible prototype for getl() on ATARI MiNT.

-	bsh + libshedit now work around a nonstandard toint() #definition on ATARI MiNT.

-	autoconf now acts more reliable and more orthogonal with  AC_CHECK_TYPE() vs. 
	AC_CHECK_SIZEOF() and carefully includes include files separately based on
	fine grained tests.

-	Added makefile support for non-atomake enabled make programs line GNU make
	for  sh3-linux-cc sh4-linux-cc sh4a-linux-cc

-	Make bsh deal with the missing definition for SYS_NMLN on ATARI MiNT

-	Let bsh use the system getrusage() on Solaris 

-	Some more portability enhancements to allow ecerything to compile on 
	ATARI MiNT

-	The man page for isoinfo nor includes the -debug option.

-	Some better warnings with cdrecord in case that the environment variables
	'CDR_FORCERAWSPEED=' or 'CDR_FORCSPEED=' have been specified.

-	Fixed a bug in cdda2wav that has been introdcued with supporting
	MD-5 sums. Cdda2wav no longer writes partial *.inf files when
	-no-infofile was speficied.

-	Automated support for System ID in mkisofs for:

	Haiku, Syllable, AMIGA-OS, ATARI-MiNT

-	Trying to make the Bourne Shell compile on ATARI MiNT.

-	New autoconf test for os2.h

-	Fixed some Rock Ridge bugs that have been identified when investigating
	in the OpenSolaris bug 6807009
	http://defect.opensolaris.org/bz/show_bug.cgi?id=5385

-	Man page description for -abstract -biblio -copyright is now better
	to understand

-	Trying to make the "string stack" in smake more safe against 
	small problems by always null terminating the string buffer.
