New features with AN-2008-09-02:

-	Next attempt wo work around the non-autoconf friendly implementation
	of GNU gettext and GNU libiconv.

-	A new autoconf test allows to check whether the installed system shell
	(/bin/sh) properly aborts with failed commands in "sh -ce 'cmd'".

	If failed simple commands in "sh -ce 'cmd'" do not abort complex
	commands, "make" will not stop on errors in the build process. 
	Note that this is a definite POSIX incompatibility.

	The most well known defective shell with respect to this problem is "bash"
	but /bin/sh on HP-UX-10.x (a Korn Shell modification) does not work 
	correctly either. If your system (Linux, HP-HX, ...) suffers from this 
	problem, I recommend to fetch the Schily Source consolidation from 
		ftp://ftp.berlios.de/pub/schily/
	Use a version that has been published past September 1st 2008, compile
	and install the contained Bourne Shell as "/bin/bosh". Then call 
	"./.clean" and compile again. The resulting "smake" will then 
	automatically call "/bin/bosh" instead of "/bin/sh" in order to 
	execute commands.

-	smake now automatically uses /bin/bosh if it is a working shell and
	the OS System Shell is buggy. Note that /bin/bosh needs to be installed
	before "configure" is run.
	
-	& before some functions in libfind and star removed

-	Mkisofs now correctly sets the permissions for "invented" unreal
	directories in UDF instread of using mode 000. The last version
	intruced a bug during the code cleanup phase.

-	Mkisofs now correctly mixes multi-extent-File directory entries from
	old sessions made by mkisofs. This is only related to multi-session
	with files >= 4 GB.

-	isoinfo now extracts files using 10 sectors at a time to speed up 
	operation

-	The bsh builtin "type" now uses an output that is easier to parse
