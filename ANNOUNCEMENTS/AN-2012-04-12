New features with AN-2012-04-12:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	autoconf/configure no longer gets confused by the directory
	"conftest.dSYM" that is created on Mac OS X with cc -g.
	Previous versions might have assumed that the executable suffix
	is ":dSYM" and failed as a result of this wrong assumption.

-	Bourne Shell: Some lint fixes have been applied

-	Bourne Shell: gmatch() now supports multi byte characters.
			This is needed to support sh case statements on
			platforms without gmatch().

-	Bourne Shell: A fix in macro.c was needed after the conversion
	from sbrk() -> malloc() in order to deal with the Linux/Cygwin malloc().

		: ${NAME=value}

	works again as expected even on Linux and Cygwin.


-	Bourne Shell: AIX and Mac OS X also define WNOWAIT but fail (like
	Linux does) if the flag is used. So work around this problem on 
	AIX and Mac OS X as well.

-	Bourne Shell: the history editor now correctly exits on a EOF
	condition (or after typing ^D) even if the OS uses unsigned chars by
	default (e.g. AIX).

-	The Bourne Shell's man page now mentions the -m option for set(1)
	that was present since SVr4 as well as the new set(1) option -P
	that allows to turn sh(1) into pfsh(1).

-	The Bourne Shell now has been verified to work correctly on:

	-	Solaris (SunOS-5.x)

	-	SunOS-4.x

	-	FreeBSD-8.2

	-	HP-UX-10.x

	-	AIX-6.1

	-	Linux

	-	Cygwin

	This was done by running "configure" from this tarball with our Bourne
	Shell. On Cygwin, our Bourne Shell results in 1/3 better performance
	than seen with bash.

	The Bourne Shell no longer is in beta state, as it now compiles and works
	on all major platforms.

-	bsh/signames.c now also supports numbers as parameter instead of simply
	signal names. This is needed to support the Bourne Shell signal handling
	on old systems (like Mac OS X) that do not support str2sig().

-	smake now links against $(LIB_INTL) as libschily/mem.c needs gettext()
	The missing $(LIB_INTL) caused smake compilation to fail to link on Cygwin,

-	libmdigest no longer tries to use #pragma waek on Cygwin as Cygwin 
	incorrectly handles weak symbols - making them local symbols only.
