New features with AN-2018-05-02:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. If your smake is too old and aborts, ensure this
	*** by calling:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-01-26 introduced
	*** optimizations for the Schily version of SunPro Make, you
	*** need at least the dmake version from 2018/01/11 with support
	*** for the "export" directive to compile with this makefile system.


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	libschily::getargs.c: Fixed a 38 year old bug bug with option parsing
	that did cause a core dump in case that something like "-l,all" - an
	option name that contains a comma - was used. This bug was detected
	with "bsh" but it has a potential to affect all tools that use
	getargs() to parse options - so all schilytools that are not derived
	from UNIX soures are affected.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	libxtermcap: Fixed a bug that could cause tdecode() to run past the
	end of a non-conforming string that could e.g. appear when tdecode()
	is called from the "map" builtin in bsh or bosh (Bourne Shell).

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	bsh: wordeql() could access a string beyond the end in case that the
	word in that string was shorter than the reference.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	bsh: "$@$@" could cause an illegal call to iswhite(-2) as the check for
	"$@" with ac <= 1 that needs to remove the argument completely was
	imperfect.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	bsh & libshedit: '"' and '\'' are now in the list of characters that
	need quoting during a TAB filename expansion. This affects bsh and the
	Bourne Shell.

-	Bourne Shell: added an #ifdef EXPAND_DEBUG to expand.c to help debugging
	hard to debug pattern matching cases.

-	Bourne Shell: When in strict POSIX mode (set -o posix), "case" pattern 
	matching no longer implements a fallback to a vanilla string compare in
	case that gmatch() fails. This differs from what Bourne Shell and ksh
	implement, but it is aligned with opinion of the majority of the people
	in the POSIX commitee.

-	Bourne Shell: try to avoid an ugly line break in the man page.

-	Bourne Shell: the conformance tests have been modified to deal with
	spaces in PATH - needed on Cygwin.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	star: star -diff is now able to compare nanoseconds in timestamps.
	This requires a tar archive with full POSIX.1-2001 extended tar
	header extensions. If the archive does not include sub-second
	resolution, star -diff implements a silent fallback to what previously
	has been done: just compare the seconds.

-	smake: man page now uses a 4-digit year.

-	SCCS: The logname() function in libcomobj now substitutes " " by
	"_". This is needed as Cygwin permits to have spaces in the user name
	but this would be in conflict with our history file format that uses
	" " as a field separator.

	Thanks to Heiko Eißfeldt for reporting

-	SCCS: The username arguments for "admin" and "sccs" are now modified
	in case that they contain space characters (" "). This is needed to
	match the modifications for the history file format - see above.

-	SCCS: The sccsfile(4) man page has been enhanced to mention the fact
	that spaces in usernames are impossible in the history file.

-	SCCS: The conformance tests have been rewritten to deal with user names
	and working directories that include spaces.

-	SCCS: Some sources have been converted to better follow the Cstyle
	conventions.


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.

-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
