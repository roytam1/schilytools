New features with AN-2008-08-25:

-	DEFAULTS*/Defaults.dragonfly added.
	Thanks to a hint from Thomas Klausner

-	isoinfo now extracts files reading 10 setctors at a time
	to speed up extraction.

-	The "sccslog" program now accepts directories as parameters.
	If a directors is encountered, it is scanned for s.* files 
	and these files are processed.

-	The "sccslog" program added two new options -C and -p to
	support recursive operation when called via "sccs -R log".

-	The "sccs" program now supports a new subcommand "log" as a
	wrapper around the "sccslog" program. With "sccs log", the
	-R option for recursive operation is supported to allow to
	auto-create "Changelog" files for whole projects.

-	The "sccs" program now supports to supress scanning partial 
	trees in -R mode by creating a file ".sccsignore" in a
	directory.

-	"sccs diffs" now always calls the standard UNIX diff program 
	that is included in the SCCS binaries under /opt/schily/ccs/bin/diff

-	The "sccs" program now supports a new subcommand "ldiffs" that 
	calls the local diff program that comes with the OS and that is
	found via the PATH environment variable.

-	star -c -dump -acl -find . 
	now works correctly as it now uses short names for retrieving ACLs.
