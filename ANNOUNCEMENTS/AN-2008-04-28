New features with AN-2008-04-28:

-	The source for the program "tanslit" has been added.
	Translit is an alternative "tr" implementation.

-	.local abbreviation support in bsh has been fixed.
	It now always calls ab_close() from the builtin "cd"
	again to avoid to rewrite .locals when readin .locals
	after a chdir from a directory without .locals.

-	mkisofs again supports -no-bak. This option has been
	removed by accident with cdrtools-2.01.01a22

-	mkisofs again auto-adds a slash to the left part of
	a dir=orig/ graft point spec if the right side is a
	directory. The problem has been introduced ~ one year
	ago when cleaning up buggy old code.

-	Minimal rscsi man page added

-	All "Schily" Blastwave packages now may be automatically
	created from this source. Simply call:

		smake -f Mcsw

	and check the directory packages/ for the resulting packages.
