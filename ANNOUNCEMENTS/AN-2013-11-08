New features with AN-2013-11-08:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	ACL entries no longer have arbitrary length limits in star.

-	Star now includes support for NFSv4 ACLs on Solaris.
	FreeBSD and Linux will follow once these platforms did agree
	on a uniform ACL library interface for NVSv4 support.

	Please note that the two changes mentioned above resulted in major
	code rearrangements and may even cause star to fail on Linux and
	FreeBSD with the withdrawn POSIX.1e draft ACLs. Please test and
	report.

-	The rules in the Schily Makefilesystem have been restructured in order
	to allow to avoid problems on platforms like FreeBSD and Mac OS X:

	FreeBSD and Mac OS X banned the not-free-enough (because GPLd)
	software to /usr/local, forcing us to add -I/usr/local/include
	and -L/usr/local/lib. Unfortunately, /usr/local/include frequently
	carries a _very_ outdated and thus wrong copy of "cdda_paranoia.h"
	which is more than 10 years old and definitely incompatible with
	dynamic linking on Mac OS X. This defective copy was first in the
	search path and prevented compilation. 

	We now have a new macro: DEFOSINCDIRS= that grants to add include
	directories to the end of the search PATH to allow us to find the
	correct "cdda_paranoia.h" first.

	Please test and report in case of problems.

-	gmake and SunPro make include COMPILE.c with wrong content in their
	built-in rules. We now clear this macro un RULES/rules.top. It is
	still possible to provice a modified version from command line
	or from the environment.

-	include/schily/stdio.h was reordered, as it prevented compilation
	of the "bsh" on Linux. This was a problem recently introduced,
	when we added #ifndef NO_SCHILY_STDIO_H

-	A new autoconf test was added to detect the presence of NFSv4 ACL
	support on Solaris inside libsec.

-	Fixed a bug with libxtermcap::tdecode() that was introduced
	with release 2013-10-10 whilt trying to reduce line length via
	resturcturing. This resulted in all ^x esacapes in termcap
	entries to be expanded to '\0'.

-	The SCCS commands "sccs", "get" and "delta" now support to store
	and retrieve files with nanosecond timestamps when using the
	SCCS V6 archive format.

	This is based on the recently introduced *at() syscall emulations
	in libschily. Please report problems from platforms that do not
	provide native *at() interfaces.
