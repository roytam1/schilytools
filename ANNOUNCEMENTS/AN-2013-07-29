mNew features with AN-2013-07-29:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	The Schily Makefilesystem no longer uses CC= for internal tasks.
	People who now set $CC to a different value will fail in a similar
	way as they would fail with other build systems.

-	Allow "static" compilation (a compilation that does not use the
	dynamic defines from the Schily Makefilesystem) on Linux x86 

-	Make sure that all schily include files except the primary wrappers
	include schily/*.h instead of including the system include files directly.

-	Added automatic support for ARMv5 and ARMv6. This makes compilation
	on the RaspberryPI also possible with the non-automake aware gmake.

-	Allow "static" compilation (a compilation that does not use the
	dynamic defines from the Schily Makefilesystem) on Linux ARMv6 (which
	is used by RaspberryPI).

-	The Bourne Shell now implements a new option -o aliasowner=name
	that allows to tell the shell that an additional owner is safe for
	alias files "$HOME/.globals" and ".locals". This allows to implement
	"su" aliases that start a shell that loads the aliases of the calling
	user.

-	bsh implements the same enhancement as the Bourne shell using
	the option -alias-owner name

-	cpp/Makefile was changed in order not to fail when $(YACC) is not
	a single word but "binson -y".

	Thanks to Antonio Olivares <olivares14031@gmail.com> for reporting.

-	Cdrtools bumped to 3.01a16

-	Star (spax) no longer extracts files with the original UID/GID if
	run by root unless the option -po or -pe was in use. Thanks to
	a hint from Pavel Raiskup <praiskup@redhat.com>

-	SCCS: sccs diffs now uses "get -o" to extract the old version of the
	file in order to be able to get correct time stamps with "diff -c"
	or "diff -u".

-	SCCS: diff no longer writes nanosecond values in the middle of
	a "diff -c" timestamp when in German locale.
