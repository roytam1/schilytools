New features with AN-2015-11-26:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	libmdigest: sha3 support was added

-	mdigest: sha3 support was added

-	sformat: diskfmt.c now casts a computation to always result in a long long
	printf() argument.

-	mkisofs: some structure part copies have been rewritten to avoid compiler
	warnigs about virtual variable overrun.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	mkisofs: Both UDF volume descriptors need to have the same ID that is
	derived from the time. Thanks to a report and patch from:
	"Ganssauge, Gottfried" <Gottfried.Ganssauge@haufe-lexware.com>

-	An autoconf test was added for the include file posix/malloc.h from Haiku

-	An autoconf test was added to check whether waitpid() supports the flag
	WNOWAIT. This flag was added by AT&T/Sun for SVr4 in 1989 for both
	waitid() and waitpid() but it seems to be unimplemented on various platforms.
	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: WNOWAIT usage now depends on the autoconf test as the list of
	platforms that are not SVr4 compatible now already contains:

	Linux, Mac OS X, NetBSD, AIX

	Thanks to Heiko Eiﬂfeldt for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: correct an #ifdef typo to enable waiting for pipe szombies
	that would otherwise be created with the new pipe parser.

-	Bourne Shell: Fix a bug with jobcontrol with the new pipe parser that
	did make this command:

		while true; do date; done | uniq -c

	unkillable by signals from the tty because the tty process groups was 
	incorrectly reset early to the process group of the main shell by
	the while loop.

-	Bourne Shell: job.c now prefers WSTOPPED over WUNTRACED as WSTOPPED
	is the POSIX name.

-	Bourne Shell: the new pipe handling now seems to be mature enough
	for daily use.

-	Bourne Shell TODO:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec trick.

	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	Implement ". -h" as a replacement for "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not excute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
