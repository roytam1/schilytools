New features with AN-2015-08-12:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	Bourne Shell: fixed a bug with the enhanced option parsing (now 
	supporting 120 bits) that caused "set -o hostprompt" to have the
	effect of "set -e" as well.

	This caused the Bourne Shell to exit when calling "set -o hostprompt"
	and later calling "false".

-	Bourne Shell: fixed a bug in the option parsing that was introduced
	when trying to add new options in alphabetical order and not after
	all single char options. 

	This caused "bosh -V" to print -V: bad option(s)

-	Bourne Shell: Since we added hashcmds and other code, the Bourne Shell
	is now Copyright 1985..2015 even when the history editor was not compiled
	in.

-	Bourne Shell: avoid a warning on Linux when compiling hashcmds.c

-	Bourne Shell man page now includes sample comtent for $HOME/.shrc

-	Bourne Shell man page now includes a correct synopsis for kill -l
	ans killpg -l


-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
