New features with AN-2015-01-01:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	Various README's, scripts and man pages have been revised to replace
	berlios.de by sourceforge.net

-	cdrtools bumped to version 3.01a26

-	Fixed a bug in star's pax CLI that caused spax -X to dump core.
	Thanks to Pavel Raiskup for reporting.

-	Bourne Shell: sh/stak.c::tossgrowing() is now a macro to speed up the
	memory allocation of the Bourne Shell

-	Bourne Shell: Use STDERR_FILENO instead of 2 in sh/defs.c

-	Bourne Shell: sh/msg.c now includes comment to explain the new
	"instrinsic utilities" that have been recently defined by POSIX.
