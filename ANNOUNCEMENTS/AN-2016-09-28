New features with AN-2016-09-28:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	include/schily/schily.h fixed a typo for a PRINTFLIKE lint comment

-	bsh: Fix a bug introduced with 2016-04-05 when converting bsh to use
	waitid(). The bug caused bsh to believe that a successful command did
	fail when in a chain. This is because CLD_EXITED has the value 1
	instead of 0 as on UNOS.

-	Bourne Shell: The built-in read command with IFS now again splits
	multiple white space the same way as with the historic Bourne Shell as
	this is what POSIX intends as well.

-	Bourne Shell: The test suite now cheks for the IFS white space read(1)
	splitting documented above.

-	Bourne Shell: The Schily Bourne Shell has been verified to work as the
	system shell (/sbin/sh) on OpenSolaris.

-	Bourne Shell: jobs.c added a FALLTHROUGH lint comment

-	Bourne Shell: printf.c fixed a VARARGS lint comment


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
