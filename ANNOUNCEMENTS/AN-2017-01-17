New features with AN-2017-01-17:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4


-	The auto configuration code now avoids to #define HAVE_SUN_ACL
	when HAVE_POSIX_ACL has already been #defined.
	This is needed in order to make everything compile again under
	recent Cygwin versions.

	NOTE: Cygwin used to implement the Sun UFS ACL interface but recently
	changed to the POSIX draft that has been withdrawn in 1997.

	Thanks to a hint from Thomas Plank <tplank@gmx.at>

-	include/schily/schily.h: better comment

-	cdrtools version bumped to 3.02a07

-	mkisofs no longer needs -no-cache-inodes to make -duplicates-once
	work on UNIX.

-	patch: sprintf() changed to snprintf()

-	star: fixed a typo in star.4

-	star: The string conversion from the POSIX.1-2001 extended header
	SCHILY.filetype has been speed up with a string length table.

-	libshedit: the framework has been enhanced to support the "new"
	Bourne Shell "fc" command.

-	Bourne Shell: A framework for the builtin command "fc" and the
	shell variable "FCEDIT" has been added. "fc" is needed to complete
	the POSIX "user portability" extensions in the Bourne Shell.

	Note that "fc" artefact from ksh from a time when ksh still 
	needed an external editor to  modify  the history.  The 
	implementation that is used in this version of the
	Bourne Shell already supported fully integrated
	editing features in the command line in 1984 and uses
	concepts that make fc a deprecated feature.

	The fc command is complete except for the old=new parameter
	for the -s option.

	Warning: the map file for the shared version of libshedit
	does not yet contain the new interface functions:

	shedit_histrange;       # report range of history numbers
	shedit_history;         # print history to stdout or to file
	shedit_search_history;  # search for history numbers and patterns
	shedit_remove_history;  # remove a single line from the history
	shedit_read_history;    # append file content to current history

	This will change, when the interface is stable and "fc -s old=new"
	has been implemented.


-	Bourne Shell: "history" is now based on the "fc" code and added
	the options -n and -r.

-	Bourne Shell: The IFS test suite has been enhanced to check for a
	testcase that was recently mentioned in comp.unix.shell.

-	Bourne Shell::macro.c Cstyle changes

-	bsh: Some changes needed as the support for "fc" was added to
	libshedit.


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
