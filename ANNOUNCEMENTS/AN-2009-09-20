New features with AN-2009-09-20:

-	*BSD comes with a broken sed(1), so we need to go back to tr(1) based
	code for GNU make in the Schily Makefilesystem.

-	Added support for amd64-netbsd-cc.rul to the Schily Makefilesystem

-	Added support for DragonFly BSD to config.guess and config.sub

-	The cdrecord man page now mentions that the -clone mode is a bad idea to copy
	audio CDs.

-	The readcd man page now mentions that the -clone mode is a bad idea to copy
	audio CDs.

-	The low level SCSI transport code from libscg for Mac OS X has been reworked.

	The code now supports cdrecord -scanbus

	The code now supports cdrecord's autotarget mode

	The code now supports to communicate with BluRay drives

	The code now prints a longer help text that instructs what to do in order
	to work against the "diskarbitrationd" program on Mac OS that tries to 
	steal us our hardware. 

	If someone is able and willing to help, please send mail!

	I like to be able to tell "diskarbitrationd" to give up specific drives
	and to set up shared access.

-	Added a hack to liscg to allow cdrecord -scanbus to work on NetBSD

-	Added a hack to liscg to allow cdrecord -scanbus to work on OpenBSD

-	readcd now only send the Plextor specific SCSI commands for the -cxscan
	option in case that the drive identifies as Plextor.

-	smake now avoids to dereference gbuf[-1] to avoid on a mmap() based malloc
	as on OpenBSD.

-	Change FILE * handling for stdin/stdout/stderr in bsh to deal with the 
	DragonFly BSD FILE * implementation.

-	Fixed a problem in libsiconv in case that the the locale is specified as
	"iconv:name".
