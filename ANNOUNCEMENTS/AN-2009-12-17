New features with AN-2009-11-99:

-	Schily Makefile rules no longer contain Simple Suffix Rules.
	All default rules are now based on Pattern Matching Rules.
	This speeds up smake.

-	POSIX.1-2008 is UNIX compliant again and allows to call
	commands via "sh -ce command". Smake honors this if in POSIX 
	mode. Note that this was already the default smake behavior in
	Non-POSIX mode.

-	Smake now treats "../name" as a valid default target name.

-	The .IGNORE and .SILENT special targets now work in a POSIX compliant
	way.

-	A new special target ".SSUFFIX_RULES" allows to disable Simple Suffix
	Rules.

-	smake -p now gives more fine grained results and separates
	Suffix rules from target rules and special targets.

-	The Smake Man page was enhanced, it is now complete enough for a final release.

-	The makefile system no longer defines Simple Suffix Rules for smake.

-	Smake now searches "makefile", "Makefile", "SMakefile" if in -posix mode,
	smake's default is "SMakefile", "Makefile", "makefile.

-	If .PRECIOUS: was specified without dependency list, all targets are 
	handled as "PRECIOUS". This was recently added by POSIX.

-	The -posix option is now propageted by smake to sub makes via MAKEFLAGS=

-	Smake added a new special macro "NUMBER_SIGN" that is initialized to '#'
	to allow to use the comment sign in makefiles.

-	The smake common code for Suffix macro substitution and
	Pattern macro substitution has been fixed to correctly distibguish between
	both methods and to no longer try to expand % in suffix macro substitutions.
	This allows to use things like:

		smake COPTX=-errwarn=%all

	to work as expected.

-	Support for Hurd on i686 was added to RULES/MKLINKS

-	cdrtools man pages reworked.

-	mkisofs Cstyle changes

-	star/fifo.c rewritten to avoid a core dump from the optimizer program
	of the SGI IRIX C-compiler.

-	sh/jobs.c::waitjobs() renamed as SGI IRIX has a function with the same
	name in libc.

-	cdrecord man page reworked

-	readcd man page reworked

-	libscg/scsi-sgi.c modified to avoid GCC warnings

-	libschily/getargs.c modified to avoid GCC warnings

-	Added autoconf test to distinct Linux ACLs from IRIX ACLs

-	let libfind deal with the differences between Linux ACLs and IRIX ACLs

-	Support for 64 Bit compilation was added for IRIX.
	Call smake CCOM=cc64 or smake CCOM=gcc64 as usual.

-	C++ compilation support fior IRIX was added to the makefile system

-	New autoconf test for extern timezone in time.h.
	IRIX has a 4 byte extern time_t timezone that is in conflict with
	extern long timezone when compiling in 64 Bit mode.

-	libfind now links against the ACL libs when compiled to create a shared lib.

-	Code was added to cdrecord to work around a bug in the firmware 
	from drives developed by PIONEER in November 2009. This affects
	drives labelled "Pioneer", "Plextor" and "TEAC".
	Do no longer call cdr_buffer_cap() before the drive
	buffer was not at least filled once to avoid that
	the the drive throughs away all data.

-	Removed some (int) casts for some ioctl()s in cdda2wav/sndconfig.c

-	cdrtools bumped to 2.01.01a69

-	smake bumped to 1.2-final

-	star bumped to 1.5.1-final
