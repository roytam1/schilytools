New features with AN-2008-09-29:

-	The sccs(1) man page is now based on the Solaris sccs(1)
	man page instead of the old BSD man page.

-	The sccs(1) man page is now includes documentation for the -R option.

-	The sccs-admin(1) man page now mentions extensions on the historic
	sccs behavior.

-	The sccslog(1) man page now includes a description of the 
	recently introduced options.

-	sccslog no longer partially prints time stamps with a one hour offset
	to the real time. Note that there is a design bug in SCCS as it uses
	local time instead of GMT in the SCCS history files.

-	Several Makefiles have been modified to support not only "make all"
	but also "make install" without calling "make all" before.

-	cdrtools version is now 2.01.01a50

-	Plenty of new comments taken from cdparanoia-III-10.2
	This doubles the size of the code!
	Thanks to Monty (xiphmont@mit.edu)

-	i_paranoia_overlap_r() does not longer increment beginA/beginB after the 
	match was found searching backwards. Taken from cdparanoia-III-10.2

-	paranoia_free() now also frees p->cache and p->fragments taken from cdparanoia-III-10.2

-	Some numerical values used in paranoia.c have been replaced by
	FLAG_* definitions.


-	First step of changes intended to allow to remove Mac OS 9 "hfs" support
	from mkisofs. Mac OS X supports UDF extensions and "hfs" does not support
	large files. For this reason, "hfs" support is an anachronism.

-	changed __malloc() -> ___malloc() for the ongoing ATARI Port
-	changed __realloc() -> ___realloc() for the ongoing ATARI Port
-	changed __savestr() -> ___savestr() for the ongoing ATARI Port


-	The cdrecord DVD multi-border code from May 2007 has been made OpenSource.
	Multi-Border is the DVD multi-session equivalent. It allows to write
	up to 1024 sessions on a single DVD.

	The code currently covers the most important case of writing to DVD-R/DVD-RW
	media.

	You need to specify -multi for every session.

-	The cdrecord man page now mentions -multi with respect to DVD multi-border.

-	mkisofs -UDF now does not longer replace controlchars in case that -J has not
	been specified at the same time. This is a workaround for the fact that
	mkisofs still shares the file name management code between UDF and Joliet.
