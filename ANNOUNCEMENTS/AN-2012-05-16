New features with AN-2012-05-16:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	The ved man page now correctly mentions the behavior of "ved-w"

-	The Bourne Shell man page has been corrected in the command section.
	The junk (and incorrect indentation) introduced by Sun (while 
	converting from man macros to sgml via Framemaker) has been removed.

-	The Bourne Shell builtin command "type" now correclty lists
	functions with case statements. There was a 30 year old bug
	that caused "in" not to be printed. 

-	A new shell variable OLDPWD= is managed by the shell

-	The Bourne Shell now supports "cd -" to chdir to the previous
	directory.

-	The commands pushd/popd/dirs are now implemented in the Bourne Shell
	the same way as implemented in 1985 in the bsh(1).

-	The built-in times(1) command in the Bourne Shell now produces
	POSIX compliant output.

-	Many lint warnings have been fixed in the Bourne Shell

-	Removed a memory leak caused by the new repeat builtin command
	in the Bourne Shell

-	Bourne Shell: Fixed a memory leak in the new stak.c code from
	Geoff Collyer that could be seen with the new "repeat" built-in
	command.
