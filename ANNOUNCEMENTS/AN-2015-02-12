New features with AN-2015-02-12:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thouroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	The makefile rules for installing man pages have been changed so that
	OBJ/<archdir>/man/ is no longer a direct dependency of the man page.
	This results in repeated "make install" calls not to reinstall
	up-to-date man pages again.

-	The makefile rules for installing localized sripts have been changed so
	hat OBJ/<archdir>/ is no longer a direct dependency of the man page.
	This results in repeated "make install" calls not to reinstall
	up-to-date scripts again.

-	SCCS admin fixed a bug that caused it in bulk mode (using -N) to
	cause checksum errors if the previous file was a binary file that
	had to be uuencoded. Admin now reinitializes the related variable on
	each new entry of the admin() function.

-	SCCS admin now also reads filenames from stdin if called "admin -N"
	(without '-') as sccs(1) also expands stdin to an arg vector and
	calling "sccs admin -N -" would cause sccs(1) to overflow the max.
	arg vector size.

-	SCCS sccs now avoids to print annoying "file not found" messages from
	libfind if called as "sccs -R clean". These messages were from the
	fact that "sccs clean" removes files that will be processed by libfind
	later.

-	SCCS sccs: fix(), unedit(), diffs(), enter(), editor() and istext()
	are now separate functions. "sccs editor" now checks whether
	EDITOR= points to a name from the sccs-Subcommands.
	The new diffs() code frees "args".

-	SCCS help2 has been fixed to no longer print:

		"Unrecognized locale... setting to English\n"

	as a result os a superfluous "/usr" in the help path that was left over
	from reorganizing the source to support the INS_BASE definition.

-	A new SCCS helpfile <INS_BASE>/ccs/lib/help/locale/C/sc has been
	introduced to the help system to allow sccs(1) specific help texts.

-	The SCCS function sinit() from libcomobj now implements more
	functionality with the openflag. There os now:
	SI_INIT		-> 0
	SI_OPEN		-> 1
	SI_FORCE	-> 2 New to avoid the check toe s.filename

-	SCCS libcomobj: some more sprintf() calls have been replaced by
	snprintf()

-	SCCS libcomobj: some BUFSIZEd buffers are now MAXLINE as they are
	really line buffers.

-	SCCS libcomobj: some MAXLINEd buffers are noe FILESIZE as they are
	file path buffers.

-	SCCS libcomobj: the MAX #define from sccs/sccs/hdr/defines.h has been
	removed and some of the uses have been replaced by MAXR,others by MAXL.

-	SCCS libcomobj: the #defined MAXLINE and FILESIZE from
	sccs/sccs/hdr/defines.h are now to be granted 8192 or more.

-	SCCS libcomobj: some previous buffer overflows now create a fatal error.

-	SCCS help: some new "common" error messages have been defined.

-	CPP: The static limit of 240kB for macro string space has been removed.
	The related data is now allocated.

-	CPP: The static limit of 4000 macro definitions has been removed.
	The related data is now allocated.
