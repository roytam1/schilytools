New features with AN-2009-06-99:

-	schily/ccomdefs.h now include a new definition UConst for
	"used const" in GCC-3.2 or newer.

-	schily/wchar.h now includes a better mbtowc(wp, cp, len)
	surrogate that is able to deal with the calls to mbtowc(NULL, NULL, 0)
	that are needed with Mac OS X.

-	schily/wctype.h now deals with the fact that HP-UX implements iswprint()
	but no wctype.h

-	New autoconf test for iswprint()

-	New autoconf test for wcwidth()

-	The calls to mbtowc(NULL, NULL, 0) now work again on systems that do not
	support Multi-Byte characters.

-	The command line editor from bsh (also used by the Burne Shell) now calls
	wcwidth() and thus is able to correctly deal with japanese characters that
	are wider than one column.

-	bsh now reports is the initial environment contains an unsupported LOCALE

-	"readcd" no longer dumps core if the C2Scan function is selected from the
	interactive interface.

	to appear as one line when using GNU troff.

		strings.
