New features with AN-2009-03-99:

-	Add -D_GNU_SOURCE to the standard include flags in DEFAULTS*/Defaults.linux
	in order to unhide needed extensions.

-	Better error messages in cdrecord when the media size is unknown

-	Try to work around a firmware bug in cdrecord for the drive:
	'HL-DT-ST' 'DVD-RAM GH22NP20' '1.02'
	that is in effect with DVD+R media.

-	cdda2wav now supports new parameters for the -output-endianess option.
	"host" or "machine" represent the actual byte order of the host CPU in the current OS.

-	Try to correct all pointers into the growable string buffer in smake
	in case that the growable buffer was relocated due to a realloc().
	This shoulc fix some strange bugs reported by Frank Kanschur.

-	cdrecord no longer hangs if the cdtext file is empty.

-	star/cpio.mk star/gnutar.mk star/pax.mk star/star.mk star/suntar.mk corrected

-	the SVr4 package definitions in pkgdefs/CSW/* now automatically include
	the right verion number

-	Trying to add support for compilation on WIN64 using cl and gcc

-	Adding support for NT-6.0 (Win Vista) and NT-6.1 (Win 7)

-	Several typo corrections

-	Several man pages corrected some problems from hypen -> minus 

-	Fixed a man cdda2wav page bug that did hide some text from the visible result.
	Thanks to Michael Prokop

-	Better error messages in mkisofs case that a specific charset translation
	is not available.

-	Better support for large files (using ftello()/fseeko()) in scgskeleton
	and btcflash

-	New include file include/schily/wctype.h

-	More correct wchar support in the Bourne Shell and in diff(1)

-	New autoconf test on whether iconv() needs a const char ** parameter

-	Star testscripts are now installed into the correct destination directory
	instead of $(SRCROOT)/prototype

-	SYSv Package Protoype definition files updated for CSW package definitions

-	Some small corrections in the Bourne Shell to allow again to use a static compile
	environment on SunOS-5.11

-	Several printf format strings with %.*s now have casts to int when the parameter
	is a pointer difference. This is needed for 64 bit support.

-	New file Schily.Copyright contains a list of Copyright holders

-	The file COPYING now not only lists the files from cdrtools but
	all files from the schily source consolidation.

-	Fixed a copy/paste error from libsiconv. Libsiconv now correctly 
	initlizes duplicated data structures to prevent core dumps.
	Thanks to Jörg Sonnenberger for reporting.

-	Fixed a bug in star introduced with the new check for:
	"Archive cannot be a tty." that could cause star to dump
	core when in copy mode.

-	Trying to work around nasty Linux distributions that try to fool autoconf
	function tests and thus may result in incorrect results for the functions
	fexecl fexecle fexecv fexecve fspawnv fspawnl fspawnv_nowait getline fgetline

-	cdda2wav now gives better readable text with cdda2wav -help

-	star now better checks the parameter for the -s substitute option.
	This is needed in order to catch typos in arg lists.

-	star check for same filedescriptor on archive and stdout had a typo
	that caused undfined behavior and sometimes star -tv output did go to
	stderr.

-	New include files include/schily/dlfcn.h and include/schily/shcall.h

-	New autoconf tests for dlopen() and similar functions

-	Code in libschily/fexec.c cleaned up for better readability

-	Fixed a typo in include/schily/fnmatch.h that prevented compilation on BeOS

-	Fixed a typo in include/schily/libport.h that prevented compilation on BeOS

-	BeOS has a /boot/develop/headers/be/support/ByteOrder.h that also defines
	_BYTEORDER_H and thus interferes with our cdda2wav/byteorder.h

-	bsh/sys.c now uses more readable code for fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_GETFD, 0);
	and similar

-	libschily/fexec.c now uses more readable code for fcntl(STDERR_FILENO, F_GETFD, 0);
	and similar

-	libschily/checkerr.c now correctly handles the "WARN" directive.

-	star/checkerr.c now correctly handles the "WARN" directive.

-	star -C missing-dir now correctly sets the exitcode from star

-	star -C missing-dir may now be handled by a new errctl= tag "CHRDIR"

-	star -X is now working correctly, thanks to a Johannes Geiss <jgeiss@arcor.de>
	who detected a copy/paste error made while -X was copied from list=

-	smake now includes a -C dir option

-	New makefile "Mocsw" allows to create packages for "opencsw"

-	RULES/rules.csw enhanced to allow to overwrite EMAIL= and HOTLINE= from
	the make command line.

-	New autoconf test for getprogname()/setprogname()

-	Support for using Microsoft "cl" to compile 64 bit binaries from Cygwin now
	has been finished

-	bsh: alias command now supports -l option for local aliases

-	bsh: read corsor maps for line editor from $HOME/.bshmap instead of ~/.bshmap

-	bsh: some builtin now have previously missing -help support

-	bsh: builtin commands now support --help besides -help

-	bsh: the alias support code now checks the time stamps for ~/.globals
	and .locals in order to prevent overwriting more recent aliases.

-	bsh: alias command now supports -r/-reload to reload the aliases
	in case that another shell did update the files.

-	bsh version bumped to 6.11

-	Cdrecord now calls read_format_capacities() in silent mode in order to
	check whether the current drive supports this SCSI command.
