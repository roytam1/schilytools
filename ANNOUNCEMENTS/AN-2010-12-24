New features with AN-2010-12-24:

-	New autoconf test for _qecvt() _qfcvt() _qgcvt()
	and _qecvt_r() _qfcvt_r() _qgcvt_r() on AIX

-	libschily/getexecpath.c new

-	include/schily/nlsdefs.h now includes macros _(s) and __(s) to support
	gettext() and xgettext(1)

-	libsiconv no longer depends on static compiled in install path.

-	new function sic_base() returns the dynamically retrieved install base
	for the siconv database.

-	Cdrecord now uses gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The cdrtools project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	Cdda2wav now uses gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The cdrtools project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	Readcd now uses gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The cdrtools project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	Scgcheck now uses gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The cdrtools project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	Scgskeleton now uses gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The cdrtools project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	Btcflash now uses gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The cdrtools project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	Mkisofs and the disgnostic programs now use gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The cdrtools project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	Typo corrections in mkisofs/mkisofs.8 man page

-	A bug was fixed with -sort and files > 4 GB. Mkisofs now correctly sorts the
	disk addresses of the file content is such a case.

-	New options -long-rr-time -no-long-rr-time -short-rr-time allow to control
	the time format used for files with Rock Ridge extensions.

	-	The short time format supports year 1900..2155 with a one second
		granularity

	-	The long time format supports year 0..9999 with a 10ms granularity.

	Note that the Linux kernel only implements partial Rock Ridge support and 
	unfortunately does not support the long time format. It is planned to 
	make the long time stamp format the default in the future, so I encourage
	the Linux kernel folks to add support for this time format.

-	isoinfo now supports the new option -find and (via libfind) allows to use
	find expressions on ISO-9660 images. If the find expression neither contains
	-print nor -ls and isoinfo is called:

		isoinfo -i xxx.iso -l -find .....

	the ISO-9660 listing function from isoinfo is called whenever the find expression
	returns TRUE. If there is a print or list primary in the find expression, then
	the ISO-9660 listing is never called.


-	star now correctly detects xz(1) compressed archives even when they are
	read from a non-seekable stdin.

-	ved no longer waits for 2 seconds when a Cygwin release is detected that
	supports file locking.

-	hdump/od now uses gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The schily project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	The float printf() format for hdump/od has been corrected to properly create
	aligned output.

-	copy now uses gettext() to translate texts.
	There are currently not yet translated texts. The schily project needs help
	with translating the texts.

-	The "p" command now automatically supresses carriage returns from DOS newlines.
	A new option -nodos to supress the new behavior was added.
