New features with AN-2009-07-30:

-	New include files include/schily/ctype.h, include/schily/pwd.h
	and include/schily/grp.h 

-	smake and many other programs are now using schily/stdio.h 
	for orthogonality.

-	New library libmdigest with various Message digest functions.

-	libxtermcap now supports more escape sequences from terminfo
	in order to become more tolerant against termcap files that
	have been incorrectly converted from terminfo.

-	termcap(1) now tries to convert illegal terminfo based escape
	sewuences into supported termcap escape sequences.

-	termcap(1) now implements a new option -nowarn that tells
	termcap not to warn about fixed escape sequences that have
	been based on terminfo escapes that are not officially supported
	by termcap.

-	bsh/sys.c fixed a bug by changing from HZ to CLK_TCK to make
	process times correct for BeOS/Haiku 

-	Correctly abort the FIFO in cdrecord and star on BeOS and Haiku
	in case that the clone ara cannot be made shared.

-	The Makefile for the Bourne Shell now includes libintl if needed
	to allow compilation on Cygwin

-	The symlink "sccs" in the main "bin" directory (that points to:
	../ccs/bin/sccs) now correctly ends with .exe if make install
	is done on a DOS based system.

-	Haiku default install dir is now /boot/opt/schily

-	New rules RULES/os-cygwin_nt-6.0-wow64.id and 
	RULES/os-cygwin_nt-6.1-wow64.id support Cygwin on 64bit
	installations of Win Vista and "Win 7".

-	New rules for compiling 64 Bit binaries on cygwin_nt-wow64
	NOTE: You need to have a 64 bit aware gcc on Cygwin to use this!

-	TEMPLATES/temp-gcc.rul and TEMPLATES/temp-xcc.rul
	now correctly include cc-gcc.rul and cc-dumb.rul and thus
	make the automake feature working again for completely
	unknown platforms.

-	Fixed RULES/rules.inc to make sure we install xx.h instead of
	xx.h.exe

-	libschily now is thread aware and uses the thread specific errno
	value on Solaris, Linux and FreeBSD.

-	Workaround an infinite hang in an autoconf test on 64 Bit Vista
	with Cygwin

-	Include limits.h in schily/hostname.h for Linux

-	Several "%s" formats have been introduced in order to make gcc-4
	happy even though the original strings have been pointer to constant
	and well known strings

-	Change the option order in the autoconf test for calling the linker
	in order to avoid problems with the microsoft linker.

-	Raised the SCSI Bus-number limit from 256 to 500 for Linux as a workaround
	for a resource leak bug in the linux kernel. The workaround lets the problem
	happen much later but cannot completely avoid it. If you are hit by the Linux
	kernel resource leak bug, you need to reboot.

-	Fixed a potential malloc problem in mkisofs

-	Bumped cdrtools to 2.01.01a62
