New features with AN-2016-10-11:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

		*** WARNING        ***
		*** Need new smake ***

	*** Due to the fact that schily-tools 2014-04-03 introduced to use new macro
	*** expansions and a related bug fix in smake, you need a new smake
	*** to compile this source. To ensure this, call:

	cd ./psmake
	./MAKE-all
	cd ..
	psmake/smake
	psmake/smake install


	WARNING: the new version of the isoinfo program makes use of the 
		*at() series of functions that have been introduced by Sun
		in August 2001 and added to POSIX.1-2008. For older platforms,
		libschily now includes emulations for these functions but
		these emulations have not yet been tested thoroughly.
		Please report problems!

	The new smake version mentioned above is smake-1.2.4

-	mkisofs: Allow to compile the code again when USE_FIND APPLE_HFS_HYB
	APPLE_HYB UDF DVD_AUD_VID are not #define'd Thanks to a hint from
	Colin Finck <colin@reactos.org>

-	mkisofs: mkisofs -version now mentions James Pearson and HELIOS GMBH

-	patch: Added a workaround for CVE-2015-1416, system() with potentially
	having shell meta characters in filenames is a bad idea. Thanks to a
	hint from Pedro Giffuni <pfg@FreeBSD.org>

-	patch: Added more ed commands to the security filter that prevents
	unsafe ed commands from being forwarded to "ed". We now permit the
	substitute command "s/.//" that is needed to support the workaround
	from diff that permits to insert lines that only contain ".".

-	patch: The programs tests/random/cmptest.sh and tests/random/gentest.sh
	from the test suite now allow to set the "diff" program for the tests
	e.g. by calling: "diff=/tmp/diff tests/random/cmptest.sh"
	This allows to use them to verify a specific implementation of the
	"diff" command.

-	SCCS diff(1) command: smaller changes to make the code compile again
	in the SchilliX-ON Makefile system for creating /usr/bin/diff on
	OpenSolaris and to pass Cstyle & Hdrstyle.

-	SCCS diff(1) command: use memcmp() in compare() as well and not only 
	in main() to sped up things.

-	SCCS diff(1) command: Mention -N option (introduced in April 2011)
	in usage()

-	SCCS diff(1) command: permit -version in addition to --version

-	SCCS diff(1) command: Added support for the -a option (enforce to
	tread files as text (ASCI) files even then they contain null bytes).

-	SCCS diff(1) command: Added support for an undocumented -d option
	that acts as a no-op in order to give CLI compatibility with GNU diff.

-	SCCS diff(1) command: Added support for the -p option (print function
	names together with unified and context diffs).

-	SCCS diff(1) command: Added support for the -q option (do not output
	diffs but only one line that mentions a difference).

-	SCCS diff(1) command: Added a workaround for the problem that "diff -e"
	could not deal with inserted lines that contain only ".".


-	Bourne Shell Missing features for POSIX compliance:

	- Support for $'...' quoting (this is not needed for the current
					version of POSIX but for the next POSIX
					version that will be named SUSv8).
					The development of SUSv8 will start in
					late 2016.

	We are now expecting the Bourne Shell to be fully POSIX compliant.


-	Bourne Shell further TODO list:

	-	Try to make

		lastline=
		while read line
		do
			lastline=$line
		done < /etc/passwd
		echo "lastline=$lastline"

		print the last line of /etc/passwd without the exec "trick"
		that is documented in the man page.
	
	-	Finish loadable builtin support.

	-	POSIX does not allow us to implement ". -h", so we will
		add a "source" builtin to be able to implement "source -h"

-	The following builtins (that are available in bsh) are still missing in
	the Bourne Shell:

	err			echo with output going to stderr
	glob			echo with '\0' instead of ' ' between args
	env			a builtin version of /usr/bin/env

	The following bsh intrinsics are still missing in the Bourne Shell:

	-			the restricted bsh has restriction features that
				are missing in the Bourne shell.

	-	source -h	read file into history but do not execute

	and probably more features not yet identified to be bsh unique.
