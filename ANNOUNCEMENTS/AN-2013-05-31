mNew features with AN-2013-05-31:

This is the first localization step for the schily source consolidation. Many
programs now (hopefully) call gettext() for all strings that need localization.

-	The next step will include dgettext() calls for the libraries and the
	missing programs

-	The following step will include the extracted strings

-	The last step will include German translations and install support
	for the resulting binary message object files.

----------> Please test and report compilation problems! <---------

***** NOTE: As mentioned since 2004, frontends to the tools should *****
*****		call all programs in the "C" locale		   *****
*****		by e.g. calling: LC_ALL=C cdrecord ....		   *****
*****		unless these frontends support localized strings   *****
*****		used by the cdrtools with NLS support.		   *****

-	Updated README.compile:

	Some typo patches from Jan Engelhardt <jengelh@inai.de>

	Documented the "LINKMODE=" macro to explain how to create dynamically
	linked bynaries.

-	include/schily/archconf.h now defines __SUNOS5 for easier coding

-	include/schily/priv.h now defines platform independent fine grained privileges

-	include/schily/stdio.h now implements #ifndef NO_SCHILY_STDIO_H to
	avoid including stdio.h from wchar.h

-	{libshelledit!bsh}/inputc.c now defines NO_SCHILY_STDIO_H

-	Fixed a bug in smake/job.c (a leftover variable "lpid" that 
	was formerly used systems that come with bash == /bin/sh)

-	Fixed a bug in the diff man page that was a result from a defective
	troff->sgml->troff conversion done by Sun.

-	Fixed a bug in the sccs man page (superflous " in some text 
	added By Sun)

-	Some files with repositioned #ifdefs to avoid unused variable definitions
	Files: libscg/scsi-sun.c cdda2wav/sndconfig.c sh/fault.c

-	Repositioned #ifdefs to avoid unused variable definitions in
	libscg/scsi-sun.c

-	libscg/scsi-linux-ata.c now aborts early if errno == EPERM. This now
	makes it behave like libscg/scsi-linux-sg.c

-	A new scg flag SCGF_PERM_PRINT tells libscg to print a more verbose error
	in case that a SCSI comand was aborted with errno == EPERM.

-	Allow cdrecord to compile without Linux libcap using "smake COPTX=-DNO_LINUX_CAPS LIB_CAP="

-	Cdrecord now checks whether there are sufficient fine grained privileges.

-	Cdrecord now uses the new flag SCGF_PERM_PRINT to get better warnings if the
	permissions granted by the OS are not sufficient.

-	Repositioned #ifdefs to avoid unused variable definitions in
	cdda2wav/sndconfig.c

-	Cdda2wav now checks whether there are sufficient fine grained privileges.

-	Readcd now checks whether there are sufficient fine grained privileges.

-	Work around a bug in sys/param.h FreeBSD-9.1, that #define's __FreeBSD_kernel__
	instead of #define __FreeBSD_kernel__ 9 that would be needed for Debian
	k-FreeBSD compatibility.
	The bug affects cdda2wav/mycdrom.h
