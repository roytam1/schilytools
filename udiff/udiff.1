.SH DESCRIPTION
.B udiff
shows what lines differ between two files.
.B udiff
supports arbitrary line lengths and treats binary files the same as text files.
.LP
It does not support many options or features and there is no best match resync
mechanism, but the output is typically identical to the output from the
classical UNIX
.BR diff (1).
.LP
If called as
.BR fdiff " or
.BR fsdiff ,
the POSIX output style is used and the 
.BI nmatch= #
resync default value is set to 1 line.
.LP
If called as
.BR fsdiff ,
the exit code is compatible to
.BR bdiff (1)
and differences in the files still result in a zero exit code;
only an error causes a non-zero exit code.
This allows
.B fsdiff
to be used as a replacement for the 
.B bdiff
program for
.BR SCCS .
.LP
Since the performance of
.B udiff
is only a linear function of the file size, using
.B fsdiff
speeds up
.B SCCS
with large files.
.LP
Since the differences reported by
.B fsdiff
are smaller that what
.B bdiff
reports, this helps to keep 
.B SCCS
history files smaller.

.LP
The normal output if called as
.B udiff
contains lines of these forms:
.sp
.RS 2
.nf
-------- 1 line deleted at %ld:
-------- %ld lines deleted at %ld:
-------- 1 line added at %ld:
-------- %ld lines added at %ld:
-------- 1 line changed at %ld from:
-------- %ld lines changed at %ld-%ld from:
-------- 1 line changed to %ld lines at %ld from:
-------- %ld lines changed to 1 line at %ld-%ld from:
-------- %ld lines changed to %ld lines at %ld-%ld from:
-------- to:
.fi
.RE
.sp
followed by blocks with the changed text.
This is easier to read by humans than the POSIX output variant.
.sp

.LP
The POSIX output variant contains lines of these forms:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.I n1\c
.B " a \c
.IR n3 , n4
.IR n1 , n2\c
.B " d \c
.I n3
.IR n1 , n2\c
.B " c \c
.IR n3 , n4
.fi
.in -2

.sp
.LP
where
.I n1
and
.I n2
represent lines
.I file1
and
.I n3
and
.I n4
represent lines in
.I file2
These lines resemble
.BR ed (1)
commands to convert
.I file1
to
.IR file2 .
By exchanging
.B a
for
.B d
and reading backward,
.I file2
can be converted to
.IR file1 .
As
in
.BR ed ,
identical pairs, where
.IR n1 = n2
or
.IR n3 = n4 ,
are abbreviated as a single number.
.sp
.LP
Following each of these lines come all the lines that are affected in the
first file flagged by
.RB ` \|<\| ',
then all the lines that are affected in
the second file flagged by
.RB ` \|\>\| '.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-help
Prints a short summary of the 
.B udiff
options and exists.
.TP
.B \-version
Prints the 
.B udiff
version number string and exists.
.TP
.BI nmatch= #
Sets the number of matching lines to resync.
If
.B udiff
is called as 
.BR udiff ,
the default is two lines, otherwise it is one line.
.TP
.B \-posix
Output the differences in POSIX style instead of using
.B udiff
style.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.LP
.TP
.B 0
No differences were found
.RB ( udiff
and
.BR fdiff " only).
.TP
.B 0
No error occurred
.RB ( fsdiff " only).
.TP
.B 1
Differences were found
.RB ( udiff
and
.BR fdiff " only).
.TP
.I other
An error occurred.

.SH NOTES
No output is generated if the files are the same.
