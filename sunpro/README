The CPP macros SCHILY_BUILD and SCHILY_INCLUDES are used to modify compile
behavior:

SCHILY_BUILD		Is set by the Schily Makefile System and indicates that
			the autoconfiguration was retrieved dynamically by the
			Schily autoconf system. This macro is not defined on a
			OpenSolaris-ON based build system.

SCHILY_INCLUDES		Is set by a build system that likes to indicate that
			the (probably statically configured) schily include
			files are used in order to abstract from platform
			specific system include files.

WARNING:	HP-UX-10.x is unable to compile C++ programs in large file mode
		because of a bug in /usr/include/sys/_inttypes.h.

		You may compile the SunPro make program using:

			smake CCOM=gcc C++OPTX=-DNO_LARGEFILES

		or by editing /usr/include/sys/_inttypes.h and fixing the
		content.

The code has been converted from catgets() to gettext() and to use only a
single text domain for the whole project. The original code from Sun used a
separate text domain for the libraries.

These sources compile the following resulting binaries:

.../bin/make		A program that is compatible to the SunPro make basic
			binary installed on Solaris as /usr/ccs/bin/make

			In contrary to the original SunPro make binary, this
			binary does not ignore the -j dmake_max_jobs option.
			It defaults to -j 1.

.../bin/dmake		A program that is partially compatible to the SunPro
			dmake enhanced binary installed on Solaris as
			/opt/SUNWspro/bin/dmake.

			In contrary to the original SunPro dmake binary, this
			binary neither supports any distributed make features
			nor any grid build features.

			It supports the -j dmake_max_jobs option and
			defaults to -j 2 is -j is not specified.


.../xpg4/bin/make	A POSIX compliant version of the SunPro make basic
			binary. It is installed on Solaris as
			/usr/xpg4/bin/make.

.../bin/svr4.make
.../lib/svr4.make	A program that is compatible to the SVr4 make binary.
			It is installed on Solaris as /usr/ccs/lib/svr4.make.
