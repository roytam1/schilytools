.SH NAME
calc \- simple integer calculator that accepts decimal/hex/octal and outputs decimal/hex/octal/binary
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
calc
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.B calc
command may be used to do simple integer calculations or to convert
numbers from one radix to another.
.PP
.B Calc
reads commands from stdin and prints the result to stdout.
The inpout radix for numbers may be decimal (default),
octal (if starting with a '0') or hexadecimal (if starting with "0x").
The output is always printed in four radixes: 
.BR decimal , 
.BR octal , 
.B hexadecimal
and
.BR binary .
The decimal variant is printed as signed and as unsigned representation.
.PP
The result is printed in two variants using 32 bit and 64 bit repesentations
for the numbers.
.SH "INPUT FORMAT
.PP
.B Calc
accepts three types of input lines:
.TP 16
.B "one number
The input line is onue number only.
.sp
In this case the number is converted only to the different output formats.
.TP
.B "unary oparator
The input line is a unary oparator followed by a number
.sp
In this case the unary oparator is applied to the number and the result
is printed in all output formats.
.TP
.B "binary oparator
The input line is a number followed by a binary oparator followed by a second number.
.sp
In this case the binari oparator is applied to the numbers and the result
is printed in all output formats.
