.SH NAME
translit \- translates characters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
translit 
[ 
.I options 
]
.I from_string to_string 
.B
[\fIfile1 .\|.\|. filen\fP]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Translit 
performs a character substitution, changing
the characters specified in the 
.I from_string 
to the corresponding
characters in the 
.IR to_string .
Since the mapping is done one to one, the 
.I from_string 
must be equal to or larger than the 
.IR to_string .
If the 
.I from_string 
is larger, the end of the from set is mapped
to the last character of the to set.
.PP
The files are not modified, all output is written to standard out.
If no files are specified,
.B translit 
reads from standard input.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-help
Prints a short summary of the 
.B translit
options and exists.
.TP
.B \-version
Prints the 
.B translit
version number string and exists.
.TP
.B \-c
Complement the set of values specified by
.IR from_string .
.TP
.B \-d
Delete all occurrences of input characters that are specified in
.IR from_string .
.TP
.B \-s
Replace instances of repeated characters that are specified in
.I from_string
with a single character.
If the 
.B \-d
option has also been specified, the character set is taken from
.IR to_string .

.SH OPERANDS
.PP
The following notations of characters are supported:
.PP
.na
.nf
c       Any single byte character not described below
\\ddd    Represents octal notations of characters
\\\\      Represents the \fBbackslash\fP
\\a      Represents the \fBaudible bell\fP
\\b      Represents the \fBbackspace\fP character
\\f      Represents the \fBformfeed\fP character
\\n      Represents the \fBnewline\fP character
\\r      Represents the \fBcarriage return\fP character
\\t      Represents the \fBtab\fP character
\\v      Represents the \fBvertical tab\fP character
.ad
.fi
.SH NOTES
When the 
.I to_string
is smaller than the 
.IR from_string ,
multiple
occurrences of the folded characters are not generated.
Translating all letters, white space and punctuation, to X's,
for example, will cause only a single X to appear on the output
stream.
.PP
If the
.I to_string
is empty, all occurrences of input characters that are specified in
.I from_string
are deleted and produce no output.
.PP
You can use reverse ranges,
.IP
.B "translit [a-z] [z-a]
.PP
will change every a to z and every z to a and so forth.
.PP
If an ordinary digit in the octal range is following an octal sequence,
the octal sequence must use three octal digits.
.PP
If
.I from_string
or
.I to_string
start with the unescaped character '^', the related set is complemented.
