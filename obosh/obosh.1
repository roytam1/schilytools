.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
.LP
The
.B /usr/bin/sh
utility is a command programming language that
executes commands read from a terminal or a file.
.LP
The name
.B obosh
permits to call this implementaton even when
.B /usr/bin/sh
has been linked to another shell.
.LP
The
.B jsh
utility is an interface to the shell that provides all of the
functionality of
.B sh
and enables job control (see
.B Job Control
section below).
Job control may also be enabled by calling the shell via the standard name
and then calling
.BR "set\ \-m" .
.sp
.LP
Arguments to the shell are listed in the
.B Invocation
section below.
.SS "Definitions"
.sp
.LP
A
.I blank
is a tab or a space. A
.I name
is a sequence of
.B ASCII
letters, digits, or underscores, beginning with a letter or an
underscore. A
.I parameter
is a name, a digit, or any of the characters
.BR * ,
.BR @ ,
.BR # ,
.BR ? ,
.BR \(mi ,
.BR $ ,
and
.BR ! .

.SS "Invocation"
.sp
.LP
If the shell is invoked through
.BR exec (2)
and the first character of
argument zero is
.BR \(mi ,
commands are initially read from
.B /etc/profile and from
.BR $HOME/.profile,
if such files exist.
Thereafter, commands are read as described below, which is also the case
when the shell is invoked as
.BR /usr/bin/sh .

.SH OPTIONS
The options below are
interpreted by the shell on invocation only.
.B Note:
Unless the
.B \-c
or
.B \-s
option is specified, the first argument is assumed to be the name
of a file containing commands, and the remaining arguments are passed as
positional parameters to that command file:
.br
.ne 3
.TP 12
.BI \-c " string"
If the
.B \-c
option is present commands are read from
.IR string .
The remaining arguments become positional parameters starting at
.BR $0 .
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B \-i
If the
.B \-i
option is present or if the shell input and output are
attached to a terminal, this shell is
.BR interactive .
In this case,
TERMINATE is ignored (so that
.B kill 0
does not kill an interactive
shell) and INTERRUPT is caught and ignored (so that
.B wait
is interruptible). In all cases, QUIT is ignored by the shell.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-p
If the
.B \-p
option is present, the shell does not set the effective user
and group IDs to the real user and group IDs.
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-r
If the
.B \-r
option is present the shell is a restricted shell (see
.BR rsh (1M)).
.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-s
If the
.B \-s
option is present or if no arguments remain, commands are
read from the standard input. Any remaining arguments specify the positional
parameters. Shell output (except for
.BR "Special Commands" )
is written to file descriptor 2.
.TP
.B \-version
Print the current
.B Bourne Shell
version and exit.
.LP
Using
.B +
rather than
.B \-
causes the related options to be turned off.
The remaining options and arguments are described under the
.B set
command below.

.SH USAGE
.SS "Commands"
.sp
.LP
A
.I simple-command
is a sequence of non-blank
.IR word s
separated by
.IR blank s.
The first
.I word
specifies the name of the command to be
executed. Except as specified below, the remaining
.IR word s
are passed as
arguments to the invoked command. The command name is passed as argument 0
(see
.BR exec (2)).
The
.I value
of a
.I simple-command
is its exit
status if it terminates normally, or (octal)
.BR 200 +\c
.I status
if it terminates abnormally. See
.BR signal.h (3HEAD)
for a list of status values.
.sp
.LP
A
.I pipeline
is a sequence of one or more
.IR command s
separated by
.BR | .
The standard output of each
.I command
but the last is connected by a
.BR pipe (2)
to the standard input of the next
.IR command .
Each
.I command
is run as a separate process. The shell waits for the last
.I command
to terminate. The exit status of a
.I pipeline
is the exit status of the last command in the
.IR pipeline .
.sp
.LP
A
.I list
is a sequence of one or more
.IR pipeline s
separated by
.BR ; ,
.BR & ,
.BR && ,
or
.BR |\|| ,
and optionally terminated by
.B ;
or
.BR & \&.
Of these four symbols,
.B ;
and
.B &
have equal precedence, which is lower than that of
.B &&
and
.BR |\|| .
The symbols
.B &&
and
.B |\||
also have equal precedence. A semicolon
.RB ( ; )
causes sequential execution of the preceding
.IR pipeline ,
that is, the shell waits for the
.I pipeline
to finish before executing any commands
following the semicolon. An ampersand
.RB ( & )
causes asynchronous
execution of the preceding pipeline, that is, the shell does
.B not
wait for that pipeline to finish. The symbol
.B &&
.RB ( \||\|| )
causes the
.I list
following it to be executed only if the preceding pipeline
returns a zero (non-zero) exit status. An arbitrary number of newlines can
appear in a
.IR list ,
instead of semicolons, to delimit commands.
.sp
.LP
A
.I command
is either a
.I simple-command
or one of the following.
Unless otherwise stated, the value returned by a command is that of the last
.I simple-command
executed in the command.
.sp
.ne 3
.HP
.B for
.I name
[
.B in
.I word
\&.\|.\|. ]
.B do
.I list
.B done
.br
Each time a
.B for
command is executed,
.I name
is set to the next
.I word
taken from the
.B in
.I word
list. If
.B in
.I word
\&.\|.\|. is omitted, then the
.B for
command executes the
.B do
.I list
once for each positional parameter that is set (see
.B Parameter Substitution
section below). Execution ends when there are no more words
in the list.

.br

.I word
.B in
[
.I pattern
[ |
.I pattern

.B esac
.br
A
.B case
command executes the
.I list
associated with the first
.I pattern
that matches
.IR word .
The form of the patterns is the same
as that used for file-name generation (see
.B File Name Generation
section), except that a slash, a leading dot, or a dot immediately following
a slash need not be matched explicitly.
.br
.ne 3

.I list
.B then
.I list
[
.B elif
.I list
.B then
.I list
] .\|.\|. [
.B else
.I list
]
.B fi
.br
The
.I list
following
.B if
is executed and, if it returns a zero
exit status, the
.I list
following the first
.B then
is executed.
Otherwise, the
.I list
following
.B elif
is executed and, if its value is zero, the
.I list
following the next
.B then
is executed. Failing that, the
.B else
.I list
is executed. If no
.B else
.I list
or
.B then
.I list
is executed, then the
.B if
command returns a zero exit status.
.br
.ne 3

.PD 0
.HP

.br
.PD
A
.B while
command repeatedly executes the
.B while
.I list
and, if the exit status of the last command in the list is zero, executes the
.B do
.IR list ;
otherwise the loop terminates. If no commands in the
.B do
.I list
are executed, then the
.B while
command returns a zero exit status;
.B until
can be used in place of
.B while
to negate the loop termination test.
.br
.ne 3

.br
.ne 3
.HP
.BI { " list" ;}
.br
.I list
is executed in the current (that is, parent) shell. The
.B {
must be followed by a space.
.br
.ne 3
.HP
.I name
.B (\|) {
.IB list ;}
.br
Define a function which is referenced by
.IR name .
The body of the function is the
.I list
of commands between
.B {
and
.BR } .
The
.B {
must be followed by a space. Execution of functions is described below (see
.B Execution
section). The
.B {
and
.B }
are unnecessary
if the body of the function is a
.I command
as defined above, under
.BR Commands .
.LP
The following words are only recognized as the first word of a command and
when not quoted:
.sp
.LP
.in +2
.nf
.B
if       then     else    elif    fi      case    esac
.B
for      while    until   do      done    {   }
.fi
.in -2
.SS "Comments Lines"
.sp
.LP
A word beginning with
.B #
causes that word and all the following
characters up to a newline to be ignored.

.br
.ne 5
.SS "Command Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The shell reads
.I commands
from the string between two grave accents
.RB ( `` )
and the standard output from these commands can be used as all or
part of a word. Trailing newlines from the standard output are removed.
.sp
.LP
No interpretation is done on the string before the string is read,
except to remove backslashes
.RB ( \e )
are used to escape other characters.
.LP
Backslashes can be used to escape a grave accent
.RB ( ` )
or another backslash
.RB ( \e )
and are removed before the command string is read.
Escaping grave accents allows nested command substitution.
If the command
substitution lies within a pair of double quotes (\c
.B
" .\|.\|.\|` .\|.\|.\|` \&.\|.\|.\| "\c
), a backslash used to escape a double quote (\fB\e"\fR) is
removed. Otherwise, it is left intact.
.sp
.LP
If a backslash is used to escape a newline character
.RB ( \enewline ),
both the backslash and the newline are removed (see the later section on
.BR Quoting ).
In addition, backslashes used to escape dollar signs
.RB ( \e$ )
are removed. Since no parameter substitution is done on the
command string before it is read, inserting a backslash to escape a dollar
sign has no effect. Backslashes that precede characters other than
.BR \e ,
.BR ` ,
\fB"\fR,
.BR newline ,
and
.B $
are left intact when the command string is read.
.LP
Command substitution allows the output of a command to be substituted 
in place of the command name itself. Command substitution occurs when
the command is enclosed as follows:
.LP
.in +2
.BI ` command `
.in -2
.LP
The shell expands the command substitution by executing
.I command
in a subshell environment and replacing the command substitution
(the text of command plus the enclosing
backquotes) with the standard output of the command, removing
sequences of one or more newline characters at the end of the
substitution. Embedded newline characters before the end of the 
output is not be removed; however, they can be treated as field
delimiters and eliminated during field splitting, depending on 
the value of
.B IFS
and quoting that is in effect.
.LP
Any valid shell script
can be used for
.IR command .
.LP
The results of command substitution are not field splitting and pathname
expansion processed for further tilde expansion, parameter expansion,
command substitution or arithmetic  expansion. If a command substitution
occurs inside double-quotes, it is not be performed on the results of the
substitution.

.SS "Parameter Substitution"
.sp
.LP
The character
.B $
is used to introduce substitutable
.IR parameter s.
There are two types of parameters, positional and keyword. If
.I parameter
is a digit, it is a positional parameter. Positional
parameters can be assigned values by
.BR set .
Keyword parameters (also
known as variables) can be assigned values by writing:
.sp
.LP
.IB name = value
[
.IB name = value
] .\|.\|.
.sp
.LP
The evaluation of the assignments is done from the left to the right
in this shell.
.LP
Pattern-matching is not performed on
.IR value .
There cannot be a function and a variable with the same
.IR name .
.br
.ne 3
.TP 25n
.BI ${ parameter }
.BR "The value" ,
if any, of the parameter is substituted. The braces are required
only when
.I parameter
is followed by a letter, digit, or underscore that
is not to be interpreted as part of its name, or when the
parameter name contains a dot
.RB ( . ).
If
.I parameter
is
.B *
or
.BR @ ,
all the positional parameters, starting with
.BR $1 ,
are substituted (separated by spaces). Parameter
.B $0
is set from argument zero when the shell is invoked.

.br
.ne 3
.TP
.BI ${ parameter :\(mi word }

If
.I parameter

or special parameters, can be assigned in this way.

.br

.B IFS
is never imported from the environment.

.SS "Blank Interpretation"
.sp
.LP
After parameter and command substitution, the results of substitution are
scanned for internal field separator characters (those found in
.BR IFS )
and split into distinct arguments where such characters are found. Explicit
null arguments
(\fB""\fR or
.BR \&'' )
are retained. Implicit null arguments (those resulting from
.IR parameter s
that have no values) are
removed.

A command's input and output can be redirected using a special notation
interpreted by the shell. The following can appear anywhere in a
.I simple-command
or can precede or follow a
.I command
and are
.B not
passed on as arguments to the invoked command.
.B Note:
Parameter and command substitution occurs before
.I word
or

.br
.ne 3
.TP 16n
.BI < word

If the file exists, and the

Otherwise, it is truncated to zero length.

.sp
.LP
If any of the above is preceded by a digit, the file descriptor which is
associated with the file is that specified by the digit (instead of the
default
.B 0
or
.BR 1 ).
For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.B \&... 2>&1
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
associates file descriptor 2 with the file currently associated with file
descriptor 1.
.sp
.LP
The order in which redirections are specified is significant. The shell
evaluates redirections left-to-right. For example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.BI "\&... 1>" "xxx\fR 2>&1"
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
first associates file descriptor 1 with file
.IR xxx .
It associates file
descriptor 2 with the file associated with file descriptor 1 (that is,
.IR xxx ).
If the order of redirections were reversed, file descriptor 2
would be associated with the terminal (assuming file descriptor 1 had been)
and file descriptor 1 would be associated with file
.IR xxx .
.sp
.LP
Using the terminology introduced on the first page, under
.BR Commands ,
if a
.I command
is composed of several
.IR "simple commands" ,
redirection is evaluated for the entire
.I command
before it is evaluated for each
.IR "simple command" .
That is, the shell evaluates redirection for the entire
.IR list ,
then each
.I pipeline
within the
.IR list ,
then each
.I command
within each
.IR pipeline ,
then each
.I list
within each
.IR command .
.sp
.LP
If a command is followed by
.B &
and job control (see
.BR "set \-m" )
is not active, the default standard input for the
command is the empty file,
.BR /dev/null .
Otherwise, the environment for
the execution of a command contains the file descriptors of the invoking
shell as modified by input/output specifications.
.SS "File Name Generation"
.sp
.LP
Before a command is executed, each command
.I word
is scanned for the characters
.BR * ,
.BR ? ,
and
.BR [ .
If one of these characters appears
the word is regarded as a
.IR pattern .
The word is replaced with
alphabetically sorted file names that match the pattern. If no file name is
found that matches the pattern, the word is left unchanged. The character
.B \&.
at the start of a file name or immediately following a
.BR / ,
as well as the character
.B /
itself, must be matched explicitly.
.br
.ne 3
.TP 13n
.B *
Matches any string, including the null string.

.br
.ne 3
.TP
.B ?
Matches any single character.

.br
.ne 3
.TP
.BR [ .\|.\|. ]
Matches any one of the enclosed characters. A pair of characters separated
by
.B \(mi
matches any character lexically between the pair, inclusive.
If the first character following the opening
.B [
is a
.BR ! ,
any character not enclosed is matched.

.sp
.LP
Notice that all quoted characters (see below) must be matched explicitly in
a filename.
.SS "Quoting"
.sp
.LP
The following characters have a special meaning to the shell and cause
termination of a word unless quoted:
.sp
.LP
.B ";  &  (  )  |  ^  <  >  newline  space  tab
.sp
.LP
A character can be
.I quoted
(that is, made to stand for itself) by
preceding it with a backslash
.RB ( \e )
or inserting it between a pair of
quote marks
.RB ( \|'\|'
or \fB""\fR). During processing, the shell can
quote certain characters to prevent them from taking on a special meaning.
Backslashes used to quote a single character are removed from the word
before the command is executed. The pair
.B \enewline
is removed from a word before command and parameter substitution.
.sp
.LP
All characters enclosed between a pair of single quote marks
.RB ( \|'\|' ),
except a single quote, are quoted by the shell. Backslash
has no special meaning inside a pair of single quotes. A single quote can be
quoted inside a pair of double quote marks (for example, \fB"\|'"\fR), but a
single quote can not be quoted inside a pair of single quotes.
.sp
.LP
Inside a pair of double quote marks (\fB""\fR), parameter and command
substitution occurs and the shell quotes the results to avoid blank
interpretation and file name generation. If
.B $*
is within a pair of
double quotes, the positional parameters are substituted and quoted,
separated by quoted spaces (\fB"$1 \|$2\fR \|.\|.\|.\fB"\fR). However, if
.B $@
is within a pair of double quotes, the positional parameters are
substituted and quoted, separated by unquoted spaces (\fB"$1"\|"$2"\fR \|
\&.\|.\|. ).
.B \e
quotes the characters
.BR \e ,
.BR ` ,
.B ,
(comma), and
.BR $ .
The pair
.B \enewline
is removed before parameter
and command substitution. If a backslash precedes characters other than
.BR \e ,
.BR ` ,
.B ,
(comma),
.BR $ ,
and newline, then the backslash
itself is quoted by the shell.
.SS "Prompting"
.sp
.LP
When used interactively, the shell prompts with the value of
.B PS1
before reading a command. If at any time a newline is typed and further
input is needed to complete a command, the secondary prompt (that is, the
value of
.BR PS2 )
is issued.
.SS "Environment"
.sp
.LP
The
.I environment
(see
.BR environ (5))
is a list of name-value pairs
that is passed to an executed program in the same way as a normal argument
list. The shell interacts with the environment in several ways. On
invocation, the shell scans the environment and creates a parameter for each
name found, giving it the corresponding value. If the user modifies the
value of any of these parameters or creates new parameters, none of these
affects the environment unless the
.B export
command is used to bind the
shell's parameter to the environment (see also
.BR "set \-a" ).
A parameter can be removed from the environment with the
.B unset
command.
The environment seen by any executed command is thus composed of any
unmodified name-value pairs originally inherited by the shell, minus any
pairs removed by
.BR unset ,
plus any modifications or additions, all of
which must be noted in
.B export
commands.
.sp
.LP
The environment for any
.I simple-command
can be augmented by prefixing
it with one or more assignments to parameters. Thus:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.BI TERM=450 " command
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
and
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.BI "(export TERM; TERM=450;" " command" )
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
are equivalent as far as the execution of
.I command
is concerned if
.I command
is not a Special Command. If
.I command
is a Special Command, then
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.BI TERM=450 " command
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
modifies the
.B TERM
variable in the current shell.
.sp
.LP
If the
.B \-k
flag is set,
.I all
keyword arguments are placed in the
environment, even if they occur after the command name. The following
example first prints
.B "a=b c
and
.BR c :
.sp
.in +2
.nf
\fBecho a=b  c

a=b  c

set  \(mik

echo a=b  c

c\fR
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.SS "Signals"
.sp
.LP
The
.B INTERRUPT
and
.B QUIT
signals for an invoked command are
ignored if the command is followed by
.BR & \&.
Otherwise, signals have the
values inherited by the shell from its parent, with the exception of signal
11 (but see also the
.B trap
command below).
.SS "Execution"
.sp
.LP
Each time a command is executed, the command substitution, parameter
substitution, blank interpretation, input/output redirection, and filename
generation listed above are carried out. If the command name matches the
name of a defined function, the function is executed in the shell process
(note how this differs from the execution of shell script files, which
require a sub-shell for invocation). If the command name does not match the
name of a defined function, but matches one of the
.B Special Commands
listed below, it is executed in the shell process.
.sp
.LP
The positional parameters
.BR $1 ,
.BR $2 ,
\&.\|.\|. are set to the
arguments of the function. If the command name matches neither a
.B Special Command
nor the name of a defined function, a new process is created and
an attempt is made to execute the command via
.BR exec (2).
.sp
.LP
The shell parameter
.B PATH
defines the search path for the directory
containing the command. Alternative directory names are separated by a colon
.RB ( : ).
The default path is
.BR /usr/bin: .
The current directory is
specified by a null path name, which can appear immediately after the equal
sign, between two colon delimiters anywhere in the path list, or at the end
of the path list. If the command name contains a
.B /
the search path is
not used. Otherwise, each directory in the path is searched for an
executable file. If the file has execute permission but is not an
.B a.out
file, it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands. A
sub-shell is spawned to read it. A parenthesized command is also executed in
a sub-shell.
.sp
.LP
The location in the search path where a command was found is remembered by
the shell (to help avoid unnecessary
.IR exec s
later). If the command was
found in a relative directory, its location must be re-determined whenever
the current directory changes. The shell forgets all remembered locations
whenever the
.B PATH
variable is changed or the
.B hash \-r
command is executed (see below).
.SS "Built-in Commands"
.sp
.LP
The following commands are executed in the shell process.
Input/output redirection is permitted for these commands. File
descriptor 1 is the default output location. When Job Control is enabled,
additional
.B Built-in Commands
are added to the shell's environment (see
.B Job Control
section below).

.RS
.LP
The
.B getopts
builtin command parses its
.I args
or the global
.I args
of the current shell, using
.I optstring
as option definition.
Each time it is invoked, it places the next option character into the variable
.I name
and the index of the next argument to be processed into
.BR OPTIND .
Whenever the shell or a shell script is invoked,
.B OPTIND
is initialized to
.BR 1 .
Calling
.B getopts
repeatedly causes one option to be retrieved per call.
.LP
When an option requires an option-argument,
.I getopts
places it in the shell variable
.BR OPTARG .
.LP
If an illegal option is encountered,
.B ?
is placed in
.IR name .
If
.I optstring
starts with a colon and a required option-argument is missing, a colon
is placed in

When the end of options is encountered,
.B getopts
exits with a non-zero exit status.
The special arg
.B \-\-
can be used to delimit the end of the options.
.LP
.I optstring
must contain the option letters the command using
.B getopts
recognizes. If a letter is followed by a colon, the option is expected
to have an argument, or group of arguments, which must be separated
from it by white space.
.LP
Unless
.I optstring
starts with a colon,
.B getopts
prints an error message on the standard error when
it encounters an option letter not included in optstring.
.LP
.B getopts
supports one or more long options as an alias to a short option.
You must enclose each long option equivalent in parentheses, as follows:
.LP
  getopts "f:(file)(input-file)o:(output-file)"
.LP
In the above example, both
.B \-\-file

is the equivalent of
.BR \-o .

If
.B optstring
starts with "\c

.B getopts
supports long options with a single dash.
Long options with a single dash have been introduced with
.B Multics
and appeared on
.B UNIX
around 1980, see e.g.
.BR kill (1).
.LP
If a long name argument follows a single dash and cannot be identified as
a long option, it is retried as a combination of single character
letters.
To suppress error messages, the optional initial colon in
.B optstring
must precede the "\c
.B ()\c
":
.LP
  getopts ":()f:(file)(input-file)o:(output-file)"
.LP
In the above example,

.SH WARNINGS
.sp
.LP
The use of
.B setuid
shell scripts is
.B strongly
discouraged.
.SH NOTES
.LP
For compatibility with the
.BR "Thompson shell" ,
.B ^
is a synonym for
.B |
as pipeline separator.
Do not use in new scripts.
.LP
Words used for filenames in input/output redirection are not interpreted
for filename generation (see
.B File Name Generation
section above). For example,
.B cat file1 >a*
creates a file named
.BR a* .
.LP
The built-in command
.BI . " file
reads the whole file before any commands are executed.
When a command substitution, a set of commands from
.BR eval ,
.BR dosh ,
.BR repeat ,
.BR command ,
.BR fc ,
.BR jobs
or
.B trap
are parsed, the whole set of command are read at once.
.B alias
and
.B unalias
commands in the file do not apply to any commands defined in the file
or inside a set of commands executed with the named built-ins.
.sp
.LP
Because commands in pipelines are run as separate processes, variables set
in a pipeline have no effect on the parent shell.
.sp
.LP
If the input or the output of a
.B while
or
.B until
loop is
redirected, the commands in the loop are run in a sub-shell, and variables
set or changed there have no effect on the parent process:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   lastline=
   while read line
   do

           lastline=$line
   done < /etc/passwd
   echo "lastline=$lastline"       # lastline is empty!
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
In these cases, the input or output can be redirected by using
.BR exec ,
as in the following example:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
   # Save standard input (file descriptor 0) as file
   # descriptor 3, and redirect standard input from the file
   /etc/passwd:

   exec 3<&0               # save standard input as fd 3
   exec </etc/passwd       # redirect input from file

   lastline=
   while read line
   do
           lastline=$line
   done

   exec 0<&3               # restore standard input
   exec 3<&-               # close file descriptor 3
   echo "$lastline"        # lastline
.fi
.in -2
.sp

.sp
.LP
If you get the error message, "\c
.B "cannot fork, too many processes\c
", try using the
.BR wait (1)
command to clean up your background processes. If
this doesn't help, the system process table is probably full or you have too
many active foreground processes. There is a limit to the number of process
ids associated with your login, and to the number the system can keep track
of.
.sp
.LP
Only the last process in a pipeline can be waited for.
.sp
.LP
If a command is executed, and a command with the same name is installed in
a directory in the search path before the directory where the original
command was found, the shell continues to
.B exec
the original command.
Use the
.B hash\ \-r
command to correct this situation.
.sp
.LP
The Bourne shell has a limitation on the effective
.B UID
for a process.
If this
.B UID
is less than 100 (and not equal to the real UID of the
process), then the
.B UID
is reset to the real UID of the process.
.sp
.LP
If not in
.B job control
mode, the shell implements both foreground and background jobs in the same
process group and they all receive the same signals, which can
lead to unexpected behavior. It is, therefore, recommended to switch on
.B job control
mode via
.B set \-m
in an interactive environment.
.LP
Parameter assignments that precede a special builtin command
affect the shell itself.
Parameter assignments that precede the call of a function are ignored.
.LP
When the shell executes a shell script that attempts to execute a
non-existent command interpreter, the shell returns an erroneous diagnostic
message that the shell script file does not exist.

.SH AUTHORS
The
.B Bourne Shell
was initially written by Stephen Richard Bourne at Bell Labs in 1976.
The SVr4 release was written by various authors at AT&T in 1989.
The
.B Bourne Shell
was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun Microsystems.
Since 2006, the
.B Bourne Shell
is maintained by J\*org Schilling.
