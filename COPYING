No non-GPL source is based on or derived from GPL code.

Note: In case of statical linking, the resulting "mkisofs binary" is a 
combination of several projects under different licenses. If you combine code
from different licenses, you need to honor the legal implication from the 
included GPL code and the other code.

If you just publish the complete original cdrtools source, you honor the GPL.
If you like to create a separate mkisofs package, be careful to verify that
everything that is needed to compile mkisofs is contained in this package.
