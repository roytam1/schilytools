.SH NAME
count \- counts items in a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B count
[ 
.I options 
]
.I file1 .\|.\|. filen
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Count 
reads all of the specified files and produces one line of
output for each input file: the number of the characters, the
number of 'words', and the number of lines in the specified
files. 'Words' is an arbitrary term in reference to programs,
because they tend to have a lot of punctuation. For text files a
word is a sequence of characters separated by white space.
.PP
If more than one file is given, a grand total is also printed.
If no filenames are given, count reads from standard input. Any
combination of options works; the default is 
(\-c \-w \-l \-llen \-t).
.SH OPTIONS
All options except 
.B tab= 
and
.B \-llen
can be abbreviated to their first letter.
The option 
.B \-llen
can be abbreviated with
.BR \-ll .
