.SH NAME
p \- browse or page through files and filter unprintable characters
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
p
[
.I options
] [
.I file1 .\|.\. filen
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B p
reads the files from the argument list and displays them on standard
out. If the argument list is empty and standard in is not connected to
a terminal, 
.B p
reads from standard in.
After displaying a screen full of text, 
.B p 
stops and displays a 
.B "MORE ?"
prompt.
If 
.B p
is reading input from a file and not from a pipe, it displays the
percentage of characters already typed together with the MORE prompt.
.PP
.B p
interprets non printable characters, such as control characters.
Control characters are transformed into the printable character space
and preceded by a "^" character. If the eight bit in a character
is on and the character appears to unprintable, a tilde "~" character
is preceded in addition. Tabs are expanded into spaces as usual on 
UNIX and lines that exceed the line length of the terminal are
wrapped around and continued on the next line of the screen.

.SH OPTIONS
All options can be abbreviated by their first letter.
.TP
.BR length =#
Set the number of lines per page.
If no termcap entry could be found 
.B length
defaults to 24.
.TP
.BR width =#
Set the number of characters per line.
If no termcap entry could be found 
.B width
defaults to 79.
.TP
.B \-blank
Suppress multiple blank lines on the output.
.TP
.B \-clear
Clear the screen before displaying each new page.
.TP
.B \-debug
Print additional debugging information.
.TP
.B \-dos
Hide carriage-return characters that are directly followed by a new-line.
.TP
.B \-end
Mark the end of each line with the character '$'.
.TP
.B \-help
Print a short summary of the available options and commands.
.TP
.B \-nodos
Do not hide carriage-return characters that are directly followed by a new-line.
This option is needed in order to make
.B p
binary transparent, so reading files that do not follow DOS
newline conventions will not be automatically converted.
.TP
.B \-raw
Do not expand control characters.
.TP
.B \-raw8
Do not expand characters with top bit set.
.TP
.B \-silent
Do not print a 
.B "MORE ?"
prompt. Only do the formatting for the content of the files.
This option may be used when 
.B p
is only used as a filter.
.TP
.B \-tab
Do not expand tabs to spaces, expand them to '^I'.
.TP
.B \-visible
Underlining and bold sequences become visible.
.TP
.B \-help
Prints a short summary of the 
.BR p (1)
options and exists.
.TP
.B \-version
Prints the 
.BR p (1)
version number string and exists.

.B "MORE ?"

.B 1-9
.B Lines.

.BR Next / No .
Display the next file. If the current file is the last file in the
list exit
.BR p .
.TP 
.B p,P
.B Previous.
Display the previous file. If the current file is the first file in the
list just start to display the first file.
.TP
.B s,S
.B Stop.
Exit the 
.B p
program.
.TP
.BI / pattern
.B Search.
Start searching for 
.IR pattern .
.TP
.B r,R
.B Research.
Re search for previous pattern.
.TP
.B ^L
.B Redraw.
Redisplay the current screen content.
.TP
.B v,V
.B View (Edit).
Start the editor in read only mode with cursor position set to the current
line.
.TP
.B !
.B Shell.
Execute a shell using the rest of the input line as shell command.
.TP
.B ?
.B Help.
Print a short help message that lists valid commands.
.TP 
other
.B Error.
All other input will cause a beep if the environment 
.B BEEP
is not set to
.IR off.
.PP
If the end of a file is reached,
.B p
will start with the next file.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B SHELL
For the shell to use for shell command escapes, file name globbing
and similar.
.TP
.B EDITOR
The name of the editor (used for the v command).
.TP
.B HOME
To find the private files like
.B ~/.termcap
.TP
.B TERM
The type of terminal for which the output should be formatted.
.TP
.B TERMCAP
This environment variable holds either a precompiled termcap entry
or the pathname to be used to find a termcap database file.
If it holds a precompiled entry that does not match the
.B TERM
environment, the termcap database is parsed as if the
.B TERMCAP 
environment is not set.
.TP
.B TERMPATH
If 
.B TERMCAP
is empty, then the
.B TERMPATH
environment is scanned for pathnames of files that contain a
.B termcap
database.
It holds a list of filenames separated by colons or spaces (i.e.,  ":" or " ").
If the TERMPATH symbol is not set, the files
.I $HOME/.termcap
and
.I /etc/termcap
are scanned in that order.
.TP
.B BEEP
The environment variable
.B BEEP
is used to suppress beeping when set to
.IR off.
This helps to use 
.B p
on a notebook in a meeting.

.SH FILES
.TP
.B /etc/termcap
The system's terminal capabilities database.
.TP
.B ~/.termcap
The private terminal capabilities database.
This file is checked first, in case that the
.B TERMPATH
environment is not defined.

.SH NOTES
If you type p with no arguments and do not redirect its standard
input, p will display its usage message.
.PP
If the terminal driver is configured to strip the eight bit
in characters, 
.B p
will display a tilde character before any character that has the
eight bit set (i.e. ~V).
