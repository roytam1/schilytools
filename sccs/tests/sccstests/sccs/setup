# If LANG is defined but the system is misconfigured, we will produce
# the error message "Error setting locale: No such file or directory".
# If that happens, the test suite will fail.  For this reason, we
# unset the LANG environment variable.  Of course, things being
# printed out in the wrong language would also mess up the results of
# the test suite.
# We want to prevent setlocale(LC_ALL, "") failing:
unset LANG

# We assume that all the files we want to work on are in the 
# current directory.
unset PROJECTDIR
