# This is a test for SourceForge Bug ID 595594, reported by Joel Young.
# This is where "sccs get SCCS" where there are three fiules (a, b, c) in the
# SCCS difrectory stops processing at b, because a writable version of 
# b exists.  In fact iot should carry on a check out a copy of c.

# The test suite fails if you run it as root, particularly because
# "test -w foo" returns 0 if you are root, even if foo is a readonly
# file. We try to avoid this by calling the "wtest" function instead
# of just "test".
# Please don't run the test suite as root, because it may spuriously
# fail.
