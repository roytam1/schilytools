The files in this directory (except for the directory "common") are
taken from the CSSC project. The files below this directory contain mors
that 1100 tests written by James Youngman. We introduced a few modifications:

-	$TESTING_CSSC			was originally set to "true" for
					CSSC and to "false" for other
					software.

					$TESTING_CSSC is now set to "true" by
					our script "common/real-thing" for both
					CSSC and recent generic SCCS (this
					version of SCCS).

					Run the tests with the environment
					variable CSSC_ONLY=true to switch
					back to the original behavior.


-	Test t5 from admin/r-option.sh	tests for something to fail with
					CSSC that is expected to work with SCCS.
					As the CSSC maintainer James Youngman
					now agrees that "admin -i ..." and
					"admin -n ..." are equivalent calls,
					The related action is no longer
					expected to fail even with CSSC.

					Test "t5" has been replaced by "t5a"
					and "t5b" that test for the results
					that are expected when using SCCS.

-	admin/y-flag.sh			This script calles "test -e ..."
					but the -e option to test(1) may not
					be available with the Bourne Shell.


-	Test "fa11" from binary/auto.sh	tries to grant that a file with the
					content "x\000y\n" to cause SCCS to
					initialize a history file that is
					unencoded. This is wrong. Leaving this
					test as it has been would cause the
					test suite to require the existence
					of a CSSC-specific bug.

					Test "fa11" has been modified to verify
					that an encoded history file is created
					instead.

					A new test "fa12" has been introduced
					that tests whether a fle with the
					content "x\001y\n" will result in an
					unencoded history file.

-	binary/seeking.sh		contained a direct call to:
					if ( ${admin} -V 2>&1 ; echo umsp )  | grep CSSC >/dev/null
					instead of testing $TESTING_CSSC

					binary/seeking.sh now checks for
					$TESTING_CSSC to allow the test to be
					run for SCCS too.

-	year-2000/ext.sh		This test used to check for a CSSC
					specific 4-digit cut-off date extension
					that is not implemented with SCCS.

					This test has been enhanced by a test
					for a SCCS specific 4-digit cut-off date
					extension. This new test is now
					enabled by $TESTING_REAL_SCCS, the
					original test is run if
					$TESTING_REAL_CSSC is set.
					

If you are interested in the test suite below this directory, please have a look
at the original code from CSSC written by James Youngman.
