The text below is the original README from the imported CSSC tests:


This directory contains regression tests for the CSSC package.

The environment variable "dir" selects where the programs to be tested
are found, so if your machine has "genuine" SCCS in (say) /usr/sccs,
you can say export dir=/usr/sccs and run these tests on the genuine
article.  This serves to test the test suite itself.

Most of these tests contain no checks of the contents of stderr.   
Output to stdout is checked, as are return values.   However, CSSC
produces more warning messages than genuine SCCS and also these
messages are in a different (more helpful?) format.
