.SH NAME
sccs-cdc, cdc \- change the delta commentary of an SCCS delta
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ccs/bin/cdc\fR \fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR [\fB-m\fR\fImr-list\fR] [\fB-y\fR [\fIcomment\fR]] \fIs.filename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
\fBcdc\fR annotates the delta commentary for the \fBSCCS\fR delta ID (SID) specified by the \fB-r\fR
option in each named \fBs.\fRfile.
.sp

.LP
If the \fBv\fR flag is set in the \fBs.\fRfile,
you can also use \fBcdc\fR to update the Modification Request
(MR) list.
.sp

.LP
If you checked in the delta, or, if you own the file and directory
and have write permission, you can use \fBcdc\fR to annotate
the commentary.
.sp

.LP
Rather than replacing the existing commentary, \fBcdc\fR
inserts the new comment you supply, followed by a line of the form:
.sp

.LP
\fB*** CHANGED ***\fR \fIyy\fR\fB/\fR\fImm\fR\fB/\fR\fBdd\fR \fIhh\fR\fB/\fR\fImm\fR\fB/\fR\fIss\fR \fIusername\fR
.sp

.LP
above the existing commentary.
.sp

.LP
If a directory is named as the \fIs.filename\fR
argument, the \fBcdc\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles
produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). If `\fB\(mi\fR' is given as the \fIs.filename\fR
argument, each line of the standard input is taken as the name of an \fBSCCS\fR history file to be processed, and the \fB-m\fR and \fB-y\fR options must be used.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS
.sp
.ne 3
.TP 13
.BI \-r sid
Specify the \fBSID\fR of the delta to change.
.sp
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-m mr-list
Specify one or more MR numbers to add or delete. When specifying
more than one MR on the command line, \fImr-list\fR
takes the form of a quoted, space-separated list. To delete an MR number,
precede it with a \fB!\fR character (an empty \fBMR\fR list has no effect). A list of deleted \fBMRs\fR is placed in the comment section of the delta commentary.
If \fB-m\fR is not used and the standard input is a terminal, \fBcdc\fR prompts with \fBMRs?\fR for the list (before
issuing the \fBcomments?\fR prompt). \fB-m\fR is
only useful when the \fBv\fR flag is set in the \fBs.\fRfile. If that flag has a value, it is taken to be the name of
a program to validate the MR numbers.  If that validation program returns
a non-zero exit status, \fBcdc\fR terminates and the delta
commentary remains unchanged.
.sp
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-V
Prints the
.B cdc
version number string and exists.

.sp
.ne 3
.TP
.BI \-y [comment]
Use \fIcomment\fR as the annotation
in the delta commentary. The previous comments are retained; the \fIcomment\fR is added along with a notation that the commentary
was changed. A  null \fIcomment\fR leaves the commentary
unaffected. If \fB-y\fR is not specified and the standard input
is a terminal, \fBcdc\fR prompts with \fBcomments?\fR
for the text of the notation to be added.  An unescaped \fBNEWLINE\fR character terminates the annotation text.
