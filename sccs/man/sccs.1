.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The
.B sccs
command is a comprehensive, straightforward front end to the various utility
programs of the Source Code Control System
.RB ( SCCS ).
.LP
.B sccs
applies the indicated
.I subcommand
to the history file associated with each of the indicated files.
.LP
The name of an
.B SCCS
history file is derived by prepending the
.RB ` s. '
prefix to the filename of a working copy. The
.B sccs
command normally expects these
.RB ` s. files'
to reside in an
.B SCCS
subdirectory.
Thus, when you supply
.B sccs
with a
.I file
argument, it normally applies the subcommand to a file named
.BI s. file
in the
.B SCCS
subdirectory. If
.I file
is a path name,
.B sccs
looks for the history file in the
.B SCCS
subdirectory of that file's parent directory. If
.I file
is a directory, however,
.B sccs
applies the subcommand to every
.BR s. file
it contains. Thus, the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.RB example% " sccs get program.c
.fi
.in -2
.LP
would apply the
.B get
subcommand to a history file named
.BR SCCS/s.program.c ,
while the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
.RB example% " sccs get SCCS
.fi
.in -2
.LP
would apply it to every
.BR s. file
in the
.B SCCS
subdirectory.
.LP
Options for the
.B sccs
command itself must appear before the
.I subcommand
argument. Options for a given subcommand must appear after the
.I subcommand
argument. These options are specific to each subcommand, and are described
along with the subcommands themselves (see
.B Subcommands
below).
.sp
.ne 8
.SS "Subcommand overview"
.LP
.ne 5
Besides the usual
.SM SCCS
commands,
several ``pseudo-commands'' can be issued.
These are:
.ne 4
.TP 1i
.B branch
Create a new branch and retrieve a version for editing.
Equivalent to ``get \-b \-e'' followed by ``delta \-s \-n'' followed by
``get \-e \-t \-g''.

The
.BR \-c ,
.BR \-i ,
.BR \-r
and
.B \-x
flags are passed to the first
.B get\c
; the
.B \-p
and
.B \-l
flags are passed to the second
.BR get .

.TP
.B edit
Retrieves a version for editing.
Equivalent to ``get \-e''.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B editor
Edit a file whether or not it is controlled by SCCS.
Retrieves a version for editing before, if needed.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B delget
Perform a delta on the named files
and then get new versions.
The new versions will have id keywords expanded,
and will not be editable.
The
.BR \-m ,
.BR \-o ,
.BR \-p ,
.BR \-r ,
.BR \-s ,
and
.B \-y
flags will be passed to delta,
and the
.BR \-b ,
.BR \-c ,
.BR \-e ,
.BR \-i,
.BR \-k ,
.BR \-l ,
.BR \-s ,
and
.B \-x
flags will be passed to get.
.TP
.B deledit
Equivalent to
.B delget
except that the
.B get
phase includes the
.B \-e
flag.
This option is useful for making a ``checkpoint''
of your current editing phase.
The same flags will be passed to delta
as described above,
and all the flags listed for
.B get
above except
.B \-e
and
.B \-k
are passed to
.BR edit .
.TP
.B create
Creates an
.SM SCCS
file,
taking the initial contents from the file of the same name.
Any flags to
.B admin
are accepted.
If the creation is successful,
the files are renamed with a comma on the front.
These should be removed when you are convinced that
the
.SM SCCS
files have been created successfully.
.TP
.B fix
Must be followed by a
.B \-r
flag.
This command essentially removes the named delta,
but leaves you with a copy of the delta
with the changes that were in it.
It is useful for fixing small compiler bugs, etc.
Since it doesn't leave audit trails,
it should be used carefully.
.TP
.B clean
This routine removes everything from the current directory
that can be recreated from SCCS files.
It will not remove any files being edited.
If the
.B \-b
flag is given, branches are ignored in the determination
of whether they are being edited;
this is dangerous if you are keeping the branches in the
same directory.
.TP
.B unedit
This is the opposite of an
.B edit
or a
.BR "get \-e" .
It should be used with extreme caution,
since any changes you made since the get
will be irretrievably lost.
.TP
.B info
Gives a listing of all files being edited.
If the
.B \-b
flag is given,
branches (i.e.,
\s-1SID\s0's with two or fewer components)
are ignored.
If the
.B \-u
flag is given
(with an optional argument)
then only files being edited by you
(or the named user)
are listed.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B istext
Checks whether the files are pure text files or whether they need
to be encoded.
.br
.ne 5
.TP
.B check
Like
.B info
except that nothing is printed if nothing is being edited,
and a non-zero exit status is returned if anything
is being edited.
The intent is to have this included in an ``install''
entry in a makefile
to insure that everything is included into the
.SM SCCS
file
before a version is installed.
.TP
.B tell
Gives a newline-separated list
of the files being edited
on the standard output.
Takes the
.B \-b
and
.B \-u
flags like
.B info
and
.BR check .
.TP
.B diffs
Gives a ``diff'' listing between the current version of the
program(s) you have out for editing and the versions
in
.SM SCCS
format.
The
.BR \-r ,
.BR \-c ,
.BR \-i ,
.BR \-x ,
and
.B \-t
flags are passed to
.B get\c
; the
.BR \-l ,
.BR \-s ,
.BR \-e ,
.BR \-f ,
.B \-h
and
.B \-b
flags are passed to
.BR diff .
The
.B \-C
flag is passed to
.B diff
as
.BR \-c .
.TP
.B ldiffs
The same as
.B sccs diffs
but the
.BR diff (1)
command from the local platform is used instead of the
.B diff
command included with the
.B SCCS
system.
.TP
.B log
Display a changelog from
.SM SCCS 
history files using delta comments.
.TP
.B print
This command prints out verbose information
about the named files.

.SS "Running Recursively"
.LP
The
.B \-R
flag lets
.B sccs
iterate the command over the directory tree below the directory
tree below the current working directory or the directory tree
below the directory type argument. Some commands are currently
not permitted to be run in recursive mode.

.br
.ne 5 
.SS "Running Setuid"
.LP
The
.B sccs
command also includes the capability to run ``setuid''
to provide additional protection.
However, this does not apply to subcommands such as
.BR sccs-admin (1),
since this would allow anyone to change the authorizations of the history file.
Commands that would do so always run as the real user.
The
.B \-r
flag runs
.B sccs
as the real user
rather than as whatever effective user
.B sccs
is ``set user id'' to.

.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported by the
.BR sccs (1)
command itself:
.SS "/usr/bin/sccs"
.TP
.BI -d rootprefix
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/sccs"
.TP
.BI -d " rootprefix
.sp .6
Defines the root portion of the path name for
.B SCCS
history files. The default root portion is the current directory.
.I rootprefix
is prepended to the entire
.I file
argument, even if
.I file
is an absolute path name.
.B -d
overrides any directory specified by the
.B PROJECTDIR
environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

.SS "/usr/bin/sccs"
.TP
.BI -p subdir
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/sccs"
.TP
.BI -p " subdir
.sp .6
Defines the (sub)directory within which a history file is expected to reside.
.B SCCS
is the default. (See EXAMPLES below).

.ne 2
.TP
.B -r
.sp .6
Runs
.B sccs
with the real user
.BR ID ,
rather than set to the effective user
.BR ID .

.ne 2
.TP
.B \-R
Run
.B sccs
in recursive mode via
.BR libfind .
If no file type arguments are given to the related
.B sccs
subcommand, the directory scan operation starts at the current directory.
If the related subcommand is expected to operate only on files that are
currently edited,
.B sccs
only operates on files for which an associated ``p.'' file exists.
For all other subcommands,
.B sccs 
operated on all ``s.'' files except for those that are in ignored
sub directories.
.sp
This option is a
.B \s-1SCHILY\s+1
extension that does not exist in historic
.B sccs
implementations.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B -T
Trace.  Print extra debug messages.

.TP
.B \-V
Prints the
.B sccs
version number string and exists.

.SH OPERANDS
.LP
The following operands are supported:
.br
.ne 2
.TP
.I file
.sp .6
a file passed to
.IR subcommand

.br
.ne 2
.TP
.I option
.sp .6
an option or option-argument passed to
.I subcommand

.br
.ne 5
.TP
.I subcommand
.sp .6
one of the subcommands listed in
.B Usage

.SH USAGE
.LP
The usage for
.B sccs
is described below.
.SS "Subcommands"
.sp
.LP
Many of the following
.B sccs
subcommands invoke programs that reside in
.BR /usr/ccs/bin .
Many of these subcommands accept additional arguments that are
documented in the reference page for the utility program the
subcommand invokes.
.sp
.ne 5
.TP
.B admin
.sp .6
Modify the flags or checksum of an
.B SCCS
history file. Refer to
.BR sccs-admin (1)
for more information about the
.B admin
utility.
While
.B admin
can be used to initialize a history file, you might find that the
.B create
subcommand is simpler to use for this purpose.

.sp
.ne 5
.TP
.B branch
.sp .6
Create a new branch and retrieve a version for editing.
Except for creating a new branch, this is equivalent to the
.B edit
subcommand.

.sp
.ne 5
.SS "/usr/bin/sccs"
.HP
.BI "cdc -r" sid
.RB [ -y [\c
.IR comment ]]
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/sccs"
.ne 2
.HP
.BI "cdc -r " sid
|
.BI -r sid
.RB [ -y [\c
.IR comment ]]
.sp .6
Annotate (change) the delta commentary. Refer to
.BR sccs-cdc (1).
The
.B fix
subcommand can be used to replace the delta, rather
than merely annotating the existing commentary.
.sp
.ne 2
.RS
.HP
.B -r\c
.I " sid \c
| \c
.BI -r sid
.sp .6
Specify the
.B SCCS
delta
.B ID
.RB ( SID )
to which the change notation is to be added. The
.B SID
for a given delta is a number, in Dewey decimal format, composed of two or
four fields: the
.I release
and
.I level
fields, and for branch deltas, the
.I branch
and
.I sequence
fields. For instance, the
.B SID
for the initial delta is normally
.BR 1.1 .

.ne 2
.HP
.B \-y\c
.RI [ comment ]
.sp .6
Specify the comment with which to annotate the delta commentary. If
.B -y
is omitted,
.B sccs
prompts for a comment. A null
.I comment
results in an empty annotation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 5

.BR check " [" -b "] [" -u
.RI [ username ]
.RB | " -U " ]
.sp .6
Check for files currently being edited. Like
.B info
and
.BR tell ,
but returns an exit code, rather than producing a listing of files.
.B check
returns a non-zero exit status if anything is being edited.
The intent is to have this included in an ``install''
entry in a makefile
to insure that everything is included into the
.SM SCCS
file
before a version is installed.
.ne 2

.sp .6
Check only files being edited by you.  When
.I username
is specified, check only files being edited by that user. For
.BR /usr/xpg4/bin/sccs ,
the
.B -U
option is equivalent to
.B -u
.RI < current_user >.
.RE

.sp
.ne 5
.TP
.BR clean " [ " -b " ]"
.sp .6
Remove everything in the current directory that can be retrieved from an
.B SCCS
history.  Does not remove files that are being edited.
.sp
.ne 2
.RS
.TP
.B -b
Do not check branches to see if they are being edited.
.RB ` "clean -b" '
is dangerous when branch versions are kept in the same directory.

Renames the original source file to
.B ,program.c
in the current directory.
.TP
.ie t \(bu

Create the history file called
.B s.program.c
in the
.B SCCS
subdirectory.
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Performs an
.RB ` "sccs get" '
on
.B program.c
to retrieve a read-only copy of the initial version.
.LP
Options are passed tp the
.B admin
program, e.g.:
.TP
.B \-o
Use the original file time instead of the current time for
the time of the initial delta.
.RE

.sp

.RB ` "sccs edit" '.
.B deledit
checks in a delta, and checks the file back out again,
but leaves the current working copy of the file intact.
The same flags will be passed to delta
as described with ``delget'',
and all the flags listed with ``delget'' for ``get'' except
.BR \-e " and  " \-k
are passed to ``edit''.

.B -s
and
.BR -y .
.B sccs
performs a
.B delta
on all the files specified in the argument list, and then a
.B get
on all the files. If an error occurs during the
.BR delta ,
the
.B get
is not performed.
The
.BR \-m ",

so that no one else can check that version in or out.
.B ID

.B editor
.sp .6
Edit a file whether or not is is controlled by SCCS.
If a file is controlled by SCCS and currently not checked out for editing,
the file is checked out for editing first and then edited.
If the file is not under control of SCCS, the editor is called directly.
.sp
The
.B SCCS_EDITOR
or
.B EDITOR
environment variable must be set appropriately in order to call a
custom editor.
.sp
A way to hide the fact that files need to checked out for editing first,
is to set
.B SCCS_EDITOR
and then alias the editor, e.g.:
.sp
   SCCS_EDITOR=ved
   alias ved='sccs editor'
.sp
Note that in order to minimize the side effects of calling the alias
.RB ` "ved *" ',
.B sccs editor
