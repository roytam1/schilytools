.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The \fBsccs\fR command is a comprehensive, straightforward front end to the various utility programs of the Source Code Control System (\fBSCCS\fR).
.LP
\fBsccs\fR applies the indicated \fIsubcommand\fR to the history file associated with each of the indicated files.
.LP
The name of an \fBSCCS\fR history file is derived by prepending the `\fBs.\fR' prefix to the filename of a working copy. The \fBsccs\fR command normally expects these `\fBs.\fRfiles' to reside in an \fBSCCS\fR subdirectory.
Thus, when you supply \fBsccs\fR with a \fIfile\fR argument, it normally applies the subcommand to a file named \fBs.\fR\fIfile\fR in the \fBSCCS\fR subdirectory. If \fIfile\fR is a path name, \fBsccs\fR looks for the history file in the \fBSCCS\fR subdirectory of that file's parent directory. If \fIfile\fR is a directory, however, \fBsccs\fR applies the subcommand to every \fBs.\fRfile file it contains. Thus, the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBsccs get program.c\fR
.fi
.in -2
.LP
would apply the \fBget\fR subcommand to a history file named \fBSCCS/s.program.c\fR, while the command:
.sp
.in +2
.nf
example% \fBsccs get SCCS\fR
.fi
.in -2
.LP
would apply it to every \fBs.\fRfile in the  \fBSCCS\fR subdirectory.
.LP
Options for the \fBsccs\fR command itself must appear before the \fIsubcommand\fR argument.  Options for a given subcommand must appear after the \fIsubcommand\fR argument. These options are specific to each subcommand, and are described
along with the subcommands themselves (see \fBSubcommands\fR below).
.SS "Running Setuid"
.LP
The \fBsccs\fR command also includes the capability to run ``setuid'' to provide additional protection.  However, this does not apply to subcommands such as \fBsccs-admin\fR(1), since this would allow anyone to change the authorizations of the history file.  Commands that would do so always run as the real user.
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
The following options are supported:
.SS "/usr/bin/sccs"
.TP
\fB-d\fR\fIrootprefix\fR
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/sccs"
.TP
\fB\fB-d\fR \fIrootprefix\fR\fR
.sp .6
Defines the root portion of the path name for \fBSCCS\fR history files. The default root portion is the current directory. \fIrootprefix\fR is prepended to the entire  \fIfile\fR argument, even if \fIfile\fR is
an absolute path name. \fB-d\fR overrides any directory specified by the \fBPROJECTDIR\fR environment variable (see ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES below).

.SS "/usr/bin/sccs"
.TP
\fB-p\fR\fIsubdir\fR
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/sccs"
.TP
\fB\fB-p\fR\fIsubdir\fR\fR
.sp .6
Defines the (sub)directory within which a history file is expected to reside. \fBSCCS\fR is the default. (See EXAMPLES below).

.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-r\fR\fR
.sp .6
Runs \fBsccs\fR with the real user \fBID\fR, rather than set to the effective user \fBID\fR.

.ne 2
.TP
.B \-R
Run
.B sccs
in recursive mode via 
.BR libfind .
If no file type arguments are given to the related
.B sccs
subcommand, the directory scan operation starts at the current directory.
If the related subcommand is expected to operate only on files that are currently 
edited, 
.B sccs
only operates on files for which an associated ``p.'' file exists.
For all other subcommands,
.B sccs 
operated on all ``s.'' files except for those that are in ignored sub directories.
.sp
This option is a
.B \s-1SCHILY\s+1
extension that does not exist in historic
.B sccs
implementations.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-T\fR\fR
Trace.  Print extra debug messages.

.TP
.B \-V
Prints the
.B sccs
version number string and exists.

.SH USAGE
.LP
The usage for \fBsccs\fR is described below.
.SS "Subcommands"
.sp
.LP
Many of the following \fBsccs\fR subcommands invoke programs that reside in \fB/usr/ccs/bin\fR. Many of these subcommands accept additional arguments that are documented in the reference page for the utility program the subcommand invokes.
.sp
.ne 5
.TP
\fB\fBadmin\fR\fR
.sp .6
Modify the flags or checksum of an \fBSCCS\fR history file. Refer to \fBsccs-admin\fR(1) for more information about the \fBadmin\fR utility.
While \fBadmin\fR can be used to initialize a history file, you might find that the \fBcreate\fR subcommand is simpler to use for this purpose.

.sp
.ne 5
.SS "/usr/bin/sccs"
.TP
\fBcdc\fR \fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR  [ \fB-y\fR[\fIcomment\fR]]
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/sccs"
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fBcdc\fR \fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR | \fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR [ \fB-y\fR[\fIcomment\fR]]\fR
.sp .6
Annotate (change) the delta commentary. Refer to \fBsccs-cdc\fR(1). The \fBfix\fR subcommand can be used to replace the delta, rather
than merely annotating the existing commentary.
.sp
.ne 2
.RS
.TP
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIsid\fR | \fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR\fR
.sp .6
Specify the \fBSCCS\fR delta \fBID\fR (\fBSID\fR) to which the change notation is to be added. The \fBSID\fR for a given delta is a number, in Dewey decimal format, composed of two or four fields: the \fIrelease\fR and \fIlevel\fR fields, and for branch deltas, the \fIbranch\fR and \fIsequence\fR fields.  For instance, the \fBSID\fR for the initial delta is normally \fB1.1\fR.

.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-y\fR"[\fIcomment\fR]"\fR
.sp .6
Specify the comment with which to annotate the delta commentary. If \fB-y\fR is omitted, \fBsccs\fR prompts for a comment. A null \fIcomment\fR results in an empty annotation.
.RE

.sp
.ne 5
.SS "/usr/bin/sccs"
.TP
\fBcheck\fR [\fB-b\fR] [\fB-u\fR[\fIusername\fR] ]
.SS "/usr/xpg4/bin/sccs"
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fBcheck\fR [\fB-b\fR] [\fB-u\fR [\fIusername\fR] | \fB-U\fR ]\fR
.sp .6
Check for files currently being edited. Like \fBinfo\fR and \fBtell\fR, but returns an exit code, rather than producing a listing of files. \fBcheck\fR returns a non-zero exit status if anything is being edited.
The intent is to have this included in an ``install''
entry in a makefile
to insure that everything is included into the
.SM SCCS
file
before a version is installed.
.ne 2
.RS
.TP
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR

Ignore branches.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-u\fR[\fIusername\fR] | \fB-u\fR [ \fIusername\fR] | \fB-U\fR\fR
.sp .6
Check only files being edited by you.  When \fIusername\fR is specified, check only files being edited by that user. For \fB/usr/xpg4/bin/sccs\fR, the  \fB-U\fR option is equivalent to \fB-u\fR <\fIcurrent_user\fR>.
.RE

.sp
.ne 5
.TP
\fB\fBclean\fR [ \fB-b\fR ]\fR
.sp .6
Remove everything in the current directory that can be retrieved from an \fBSCCS\fR history.  Does not remove files that are being edited.  
.sp
.ne 2
.RS
.TP
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
Do not check branches to see if they are being edited. `\fBclean\fR \fB-b\fR' is dangerous when branch versions are kept in the same directory.

.RE

Create (initialize) history files. \fBcreate\fR performs the following steps: 
.RS +5
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Renames the original source file to \fB,program.c\fR in the current directory.
.TP
.ie t \(bu
.el o
Create the history file called \fBs.program.c\fR in the \fBSCCS\fR subdirectory.
.TP
.ie t \(bu

Performs an `\fBsccs get\fR' on \fBprogram.c\fR to retrieve a read-only copy of the initial version.
.RE

.sp
.ne 5
.TP
\fB\fBdeledit\fR [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-y\fR[\fIcomment\fR]\|]\fR
.sp .6
Equivalent to an `\fBsccs delta\fR' and then an `\fBsccs edit\fR'. \fBdeledit\fR checks in a delta, and checks the file back out again, but leaves the current working copy of the file intact.
The same flags will be passed to delta
as described with ``delget'',
and all the flags listed with ``delget'' for ``get'' except 
.BR \-e " and  " \-k
are passed to ``edit''.

\fB\fBdelget\fR [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-y\fR[\fIcomment\fR]\|]\fR
.sp .6
Perform an `\fBsccs delta\fR' and then an `\fBsccs get\fR' to check in a delta and retrieve read-only copies of the resulting new version. See the \fBdeledit\fR subcommand for a description of \fB-s\fR and \fB-y\fR. \fBsccs\fR performs a \fBdelta\fR on all the files specified in the argument list, and then a  \fBget\fR on all the files. If an error occurs during the \fBdelta\fR, the \fBget\fR is not performed.
The 
.BR \-m ", " \-p ", " \-r , 
.BR \-s ", and " \-y
flags will be passed to delta,
and the 
.BR \-b ", " \-c ", " \-e , 
.BR \-i ", " \-k ", " \-l ,
.BR \-s ", and " \-x
flags will be passed to get.

.sp

\fB\fBdelta\fR [\fB-s\fR] [\fB-y\fR[\fIcomment\fR]\|]\fR
.sp .6
Check in pending changes. Records the line-by-line changes introduced while the file was checked out. The effective user \fBID\fR must be the same as the \fBID\fR of the person who has the file checked out. Refer to \fBsccs-delta\fR(1). See the \fBdeledit\fR subcommand for a description of \fB-s\fR and \fB-y\fR.

Compare (in \fBdiff\fR(1) format) the working copy of a file that is checked out for editing, with a version from the \fBSCCS\fR history.
Use the most recent checked-in version by default. The \fBdiffs\fR subcommand accepts the same options as \fBdiff\fR.
.sp
Any \fB-r\fR, \fB-c\fR, \fB-i\fR, \fB-x\fR, and \fB-t\fR options are passed to subcommand \fBget\fR. A \fB-C\fR option is passed to \fBdiff\fR as \fB-c\fR. An \fB-I\fR option is passed
to \fBdiff\fR as \fB-i\fR.

Revise a (leaf) delta.  Remove the indicated delta from the \fBSCCS\fR history, but leave a working copy of the current version in the directory. This is useful for incorporating trivial updates for which no audit record is needed, or for revising the delta commentary. \fBfix\fR must be followed by a \fB-r\fR option, to specify the \fBSID\fR of the delta to remove. The indicated delta must be the most recent (leaf) delta in its branch. Use \fBfix\fR with caution since it does not leave an audit trail of differences (although
the previous commentary is retained within the history file).

.rt  
If contains an absolute path name (beginning with a slash), \fBsccs\fR searches for \fBSCCS\fR history files in the directory given by that variable.
.sp
If \fBPROJECTDIR\fR does not begin with a slash, it is taken as the name of a user, and \fBsccs\fR searches the \fBsrc\fR or \fBsource\fR subdirectory of that user's home directory for history files. If such a directory is found, it is used.
Otherwise, the value is used as a relative path name.
