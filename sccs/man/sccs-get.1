.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The \fBget\fR utility retrieves a working copy from the SCCS history file, according to the specified options.
.sp

.LP
For each \fIs.filename\fR argument, \fBget\fR displays the  SCCS delta \fBID\fR (SID) and number of lines retrieved.
.sp

.LP
If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the \fBget\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR' as the \fIs.filename\fR argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard input, one \fBs.\fRfile per
line.
.sp

.LP
The retrieved file normally has the same filename base as the \fBs.\fRfile, less the prefix, and is  referred to as the \fBg-\fRfile.
.sp

.LP
For each file processed, \fBget\fR responds (on the standard output) with the \fBSID\fR being accessed, and with the number of lines retrieved from the \fBs.\fRfile.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS

.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-a\fR\fIsequence\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Retrieves the version corresponding to the indicated delta sequence number. This option is used primarily by the SCCS \fBcomb\fR command (see 
\fBsccs-comb\fR(1)). For users, \fB-r\fR is an easier way to specify a version. The \fB-a\fR option supersedes the \fB-r\fR option when both are used.
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Creates a new branch. Used with the \fB-e\fR option to indicate that the new delta should have a \fBSID\fR in a new branch. Instead of incrementing the level for version to be checked in, \fBget\fR indicates in the \fBp.\fRfile that the delta to be checked in should either initialize a new branch and sequence (if there is no existing branch at the current level), or
increment the branch component of the \fBSID\fR. If the \fBb\fR flag is not set in the \fBs.\fRfile, this option is ignored.
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-c\fR \fIdate-time\fR | \fB-c\fR\fIdate-time\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Retrieves the latest version checked in prior to the date and time indicated by the \fIdate-time\fR argument. \fIdate-time\fR takes the form:
.sp

.sp
 \fIyy\fR[\fImm\fR[\fIdd\fR[ \fIhh\fR[\fImm\fR[\fIss\fR]\|]\|]\|]\|]
.sp

.sp
Units omitted from the indicated date and time default to their maximum possible values; that is \fB\fR\fB-c\fR\fB7502\fR is equivalent to \fB\fR\fB-c\fR\fB750228235959\fR. Values of \fIyy\fR in the range \fB69\fR\(mi\fB99\fR refer to the twentieth century. Values in the range \fB00\fR\(mi\fB68\fR refer to the twenty-first century. Any number of non-numeric characters may separate
the various 2 digit components. If white-space characters occur, the \fIdate-time\fR specification must be quoted.
.sp

.RE

.sp
.ne 2
.mk
.na
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
.ad
.RS 28n
.rt  
Retrieves a version for editing. With this option, \fBget\fR places a lock on the \fBs.\fRfile, so that no one else can check in changes to the version  you have checked out. If the \fBj\fR flag is set in the \fBs.\fRfile, the lock is advisory: \fBget\fR issues a warning message. Concurrent use of `\fBget\fR  \fB-e\fR' for different \fBSID\fRs is allowed. However, \fBget\fR will not check out a version of the file if a writable version is present in the directory. All SCCS file protections stored in the \fBs.\fRfile, including the release ceiling, floor, and authorized user list, are honored by `\fBget\fR \fB-e\fR'.

.sp

.mk
.na
\fB\fB-r\fR[\fIsid\fR]\fR
.ad
.RS 9n
.rt  
Retrieves the version corresponding to the indicated \fBSID\fR (delta).
.sp

.sp
The \fBSID\fR for a given delta is a number, in Dewey decimal format, composed of two or four fields: the \fIrelease\fR and \fIlevel\fR fields, and for branch deltas, the \fIbranch\fR and \fIsequence\fR fields.  For instance, if \fB1.2\fR is the \fBSID\fR, \fB1\fR is the release, and \fB2\fR is the level number.  If \fB1.2.3.4\fR is the \fBSID,\fR \fB3\fR is the branch and \fB4\fR is the sequence number.
.sp

.sp
You need not specify the entire \fBSID\fR to retrieve a version with \fBget\fR. When you omit \fB-r\fR altogether, or when you omit both release and level, \fBget\fR normally retrieves the highest release and level.  If the \fBd\fR flag is set to an \fBSID\fR in the \fBs.\fRfile and you omit the \fBSID\fR, \fBget\fR retrieves the default
version indicated by that flag.
.sp

.sp
When you specify a release but omit the level, \fBget\fR retrieves the highest level in that release. If that release does not exist, \fBget\fR retrieves highest level from the next-highest existing release.
.sp

.sp
Similarly with branches, if you specify a release, level and branch, \fBget\fR retrieves the highest sequence in that branch.
