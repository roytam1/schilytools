.SH NAME
sccs-prt, prt \- display delta table information from an SCCS file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.LP
.nf
\fB/usr/ccs/bin/prt\fR [\fB-abdefistu\fR] [\fB-c\fR\fIdate-time\fR] [\fB-r\fR\fIdate-time\fR] 
    [\fB-y\fR\fIsid\fR] \fIs.filename\fR...
.fi

.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
\fBprt\fR prints selected portions of an \fBSCCS\fR file.  By default, it prints the delta table (version log).
.sp

.LP
If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the \fBprt\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR' as the \fIs.filename\fR argument indicates that the names
of files are to be read from the standard input, one \fBs.\fRfile per line.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS

.LP
If any option other than \fB-y\fR, \fB-c\fR, or \fB-r\fR is supplied, the name of each file being processed (preceded by one \fBNEWLINE\fR
and followed by two \fBNEWLINE\fR characters) appears above its contents.
.sp

.LP
If none of the \fB-u\fR, \fB-f\fR, \fB-t\fR, or \fB-b\fR options are used, \fB-d\fR is assumed. \fB-s\fR, \fB-i\fR are mutually
exclusive, as are \fB-c\fR and \fB-r\fR.

Exclude delta table entries that are specified cutoff date and time. Each entry is printed as a single line,
preceded by the name of the \fBSCCS\fR file.  This format (also produced by \fB-r\fR \fB,\fR and \fB-y\fR) makes it easy to sort multiple delta
tables in chronological order. When both \fB-y\fR and \fB-c\fR, or \fB-y\fR and \fB-r\fR are supplied, \fBprt\fR stops printing when the first of the
two conditions is met.
