.SH NAME

.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
\fBprt\fR prints selected portions of an \fBSCCS\fR file.  By default, it prints the delta table (version log).
.sp

.LP
If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the \fBprt\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR' as the \fIs.filename\fR argument indicates that the names
of files are to be read from the standard input, one \fBs.\fRfile per line.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS

.LP
If any option other than \fB-y\fR, \fB-c\fR, or \fB-r\fR is supplied, the name of each file being processed (preceded by one \fBNEWLINE\fR
and followed by two \fBNEWLINE\fR characters) appears above its contents.
.sp

.LP
If none of the \fB-u\fR, \fB-f\fR, \fB-t\fR, or \fB-b\fR options are used, \fB-d\fR is assumed. \fB-s\fR, \fB-i\fR are mutually
exclusive, as are \fB-c\fR and \fB-r\fR.
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.TP 13
\fB\fB-a\fR\fR
Display log entries for all deltas, including those marked as removed.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-b\fR\fR
Print the body of the \fBs.\fRfile.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
Print delta table entries.  This is the default.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-e\fR\fR
Everything.  This option implies \fB-d\fR, \fB-i\fR, \fB-u\fR, \fB-f\fR, and \fB-t\fR.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-f\fR\fR
Print the flags of each named \fBs.\fRfile.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-i\fR\fR
Print the serial numbers of included, excluded, and ignored deltas.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
Print only the first line of the delta table entries; that is, only up to the statistics.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-t\fR\fR
Print the descriptive text contained in the \fBs.\fRfile.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-u\fR\fR
Print the user-names and/or numerical group \fBIDs\fR of users allowed to make deltas.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-c\fR\fIdate-time\fR\fR
Exclude delta table entries that are specified cutoff date and time. Each entry is printed as a single line,
preceded by the name of the \fBSCCS\fR file.  This format (also produced by \fB-r\fR \fB,\fR and \fB-y\fR) makes it easy to sort multiple delta
tables in chronological order. When both \fB-y\fR and \fB-c\fR, or \fB-y\fR and \fB-r\fR are supplied, \fBprt\fR stops printing when the first of the
two conditions is met.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-r\fR\fIdate-time\fR\fR
Exclude delta table entries that are newer than the specified cutoff date and time.

.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-y\fR\fIsid\fR\fR
Exclude delta table entries made prior to the \fBSID\fR specified.  If no delta in the
table has the specified SID, the entire table is printed.  If no \fBSID\fR is specified, the most recent delta is printed.

.ne 3
.TP
.B \-V
Prints the
.B prt
version number string and exists.

.SH AUTHORS
The
.B SCCS
suite was origininally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs in 1972.
Release 4.0 of
.BR SCCS ,
introducing new versions of the programs
.BR admin (1),
.BR get (1),
.BR prt (1),
and
.BR delta (1)
was published on February 18, 1977; it introduced the new text based
.B SCCS\ v4
history file format (previous
.B SCCS
releases used a binary history file format).
The
.B SCCS
suite
was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun Microsystems.
Since 2006, the
.B SCCS
suite is maintained by J\*org Schilling.
