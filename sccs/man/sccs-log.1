.I file1 .. filen

. \" .SH RETURNS
. \" .SH ERRORS
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.B \-a
.B sccslog
normally collects all deltas with the same delta comment and prints them
as one log table entry in case the related delta time for the files differs
no more than one day. With 
.BR \-a ,
.B sccslog
collects only those deltas that have been created within 60 seconds.
.TP
.B \-aa
With 
.BR \-aa ,
.B sccslog
collects only deltas that have been created in the same second.
.TP
.BI \-C dir
Use
.I dir
as base directory for printed file names in the output.
This option is used by
.B "sccs \-R"
to tell
.B sccslog
to print filenames that are suitable for complete project changelog files.
.TP
.BI \-p " subdir"
Tell
.B sccslog
to use 
.I subdir
when dealing with file names.
.TP
.B \-x
Print all comment lines, even those lines that start with
.B ^Ac_ 
and thus are no real comment but represent SCCS v6 metadata
that has been wrapped as comment to survive modifications by SCCS v4 programs.
Such wrapped data is file specific and will prevent to find more files with
the same delta comment.
