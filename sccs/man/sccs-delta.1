.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The \fBdelta\fR utility checks in a record of the line-by-line differences made to a checked-out version of a file under \fBSCCS\fR control. These changes are taken from the writable working copy that was retrieved using the \fBSCCS\fR \fBget\fR command (see 
\fBsccs-get\fR(1)).
This working copy does not have the `\fBs.\fR' prefix, and is also referred to as a \fBg\fR-file.
.sp

.LP
If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the \fBdelta\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR' as the \fIs.filename\fR argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard input, one \fBs.\fRfile per
line (requires \fB-y\fR, and in some cases, \fB-m\fR).
.sp

.LP
\fBdelta\fR may issue prompts on the standard output depending upon the options specified and the flags that are set in the \fBs.\fRfile (see 
\fBsccs-admin\fR(1), and the \fB-m\fR and \fB-y\fR options below, for details).
.sp

.SS /usr/xpg4/bin/delta

.LP
The \fBSID\fR of the delta is not echoed to \fBstdout\fR.
.sp

.SH OPTIONS

.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.TP 26
\fB\fB-d\fR\fR
Use command 
\fBdiff\fR(1) instead of 
\fBbdiff\fR(1). Returns exit status
.B 2
instead of
.B 1
if the
.I s.filename
argument is not specified.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-n\fR\fR
Retain the edited \fBg\fR-file, which is normally removed at the completion of processing.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-p\fR\fR
Display line-by-line differences (in 
\fBdiff\fR(1) format) on the standard output.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
Silent.  Do not display warning or confirmation messages.  Do not suppress error messages (which are written to standard error).
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-g\fR \fIsid-list\fR | \fB-g\fR\fIsid-list\fR\fR
Specify a list of deltas to omit when the file is accessed at the \fBSCCS\fR version \fBID\fR (\fBSID\fR) created by this delta. \fIsid-list\fR is a comma-separated list of \fBSID\fRs. To specify a range of deltas, use a `\fB\(mi\fR' separator instead of a comma, between two \fBSID\fRs in the list.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImr-list\fR | \fB-m\fR\fImr-list\fR\fR
If the SCCS file has the \fBv\fR flag set (see 
\fBsccs-admin\fR(1)), you must supply one or more Modification Request (MR) numbers for the new delta. When specifying more than one MR number on the command line, \fImr-list\fR takes the form of a quoted, space-separated list. If \fB-m\fR is not used and the standard input is a terminal, \fBdelta\fR prompts with \fBMRs?\fR for the list (before issuing the \fBcomments?\fR prompt). If the \fBv\fR flag in the \fBs.\fRfile has a value, it is taken to be the name of a program to validate the MR numbers. If that validation program returns a non-zero exit status, \fBdelta\fR terminates
without checking in the changes.
.sp
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-o
Use the original time of the edited file for the delta time
when applying the delta.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIsid\fR | \fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR\fR
When two or more versions are checked out, specify the version to check in. This \fBSID\fR value can be either the \fBSID\fR specified on the \fBget\fR command line, or the \fBSID\fR of the new version to be checked in as reported by \fBget\fR. A diagnostic
results if the specified \fBSID\fR is ambiguous, or if one is required but not supplied.
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-y\fR[\fIcomment\fR]\fR
Supply a comment for the delta table (version log). A null comment is accepted, and produces an empty commentary in the log. If \fB-y\fR is not specified and the standard input is a terminal, \fBdelta\fR prompts with `\fBcomments?\fR'. An unescaped NEWLINE terminates the comment.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-V
Prints the
.B delta
version number string and exists.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

Use the \fBSCCS\fR \fBhelp\fR command for explanations (see 
\fBsccs-help\fR(1)).
.sp

.SH WARNINGS

.LP
Lines beginning with an \fBASCII SOH\fR character (binary 001) cannot be placed in the \fBSCCS\fR file unless the \fBSOH\fR is escaped. This character has special meaning to \fBSCCS\fR (see 
\fBsccsfile\fR(4)) and produces an error.
