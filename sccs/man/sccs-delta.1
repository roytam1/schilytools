.SH DESCRIPTION

.LP
The \fBdelta\fR utility checks in a record of the line-by-line differences made to a checked-out version of a file under \fBSCCS\fR control. These changes are taken from the writable working copy that was retrieved using the \fBSCCS\fR \fBget\fR command (see 
\fBsccs-get\fR(1)).
This working copy does not have the `\fBs.\fR' prefix, and is also referred to as a \fBg\fR-file.
.sp

.LP
If a directory name is used in place of the \fIs.filename\fR argument, the \fBdelta\fR command applies to all \fBs.\fRfiles in that directory. Unreadable \fBs.\fRfiles produce an error; processing continues with the next file (if any). The use of `\fB\(mi\fR' as the \fIs.filename\fR argument indicates that the names of files are to be read from the standard input, one \fBs.\fRfile per
line (requires \fB-y\fR, and in some cases, \fB-m\fR).
.sp

.LP
\fBdelta\fR may issue prompts on the standard output depending upon the options specified and the flags that are set in the \fBs.\fRfile (see 
\fBsccs-admin\fR(1), and the \fB-m\fR and \fB-y\fR options below, for details).
.sp

.SH OPTIONS

.LP
The following options are supported:
.sp

.sp
.ne 2
.TP 26
.B -d
Use command 
\fBdiff\fR(1) instead of 
\fBbdiff\fR(1). Returns exit status
.B 2
instead of
.B 1
if the
.BI s. filename
argument is not specified.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B -f
In NSE mode, this option allows to enforce a delta even when no
.BI p. file
exists.
The new SID is assigned using the same rules as with
.BR "get -e" .
.sp
This option is an undocumented
.B \s-1SUN\s+1
extension that does not exist in historic
.B sccs 
implementations.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B -h
In NSE mode, this option allows to use
.BR diffh (1)
for large files.
.sp
This option is currently defunct.
.sp
This option is an undocumented
.B \s-1SUN\s+1
extension that does not exist in historic
.B sccs 
implementations.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B -n
Retain the edited \fBg\fR-file, which is normally removed at the completion of processing.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B -p
Display line-by-line differences (in 
\fBdiff\fR(1) format) on the standard output.
.sp
.ne 3
.TP
.BI -q\fR[ nsedelim\fR]
Enable
.B NSE
mode.
If
.B NSE
mode is enabled, several
.B NSE
related extensions may be used.
In this release, the value of
.I nsedelim
is ignored.
.sp
In NSE mode,
.B delta
behaves as if the
.B \-o
option was specified and never issues a warning about missing
.BR "id keyword" s.
.sp
This option is an undocumented
.B \s-1SUN\s+1
extension that does not exist in historic
.B sccs 
implementations.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-s\fR\fR
Silent.  Do not display warning or confirmation messages.  Do not suppress error messages (which are written to standard error).
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-g\fR \fIsid-list\fR | \fB-g\fR\fIsid-list\fR\fR
Specify a list of deltas to omit when the file is accessed at the
.B SCCS
version
.B ID
.RB ( SID )
created by this delta.
This causes the file to be checked out later to differ
from the checked in file unless
.RB ` "get -i\c
.IR sid-list '
with the same
.I sid-list
is specified during checkout.
.I sid-list
is a comma-separated list of
.IR SID s.
To specify a range of deltas, use a
.RB ` \(mi '
separator instead of a comma, between two
.BR SID s
in the list.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-m\fR \fImr-list\fR | \fB-m\fR\fImr-list\fR\fR
If the SCCS file has the
.B v
flag set (see 
.BR sccs-admin (1)),
you must supply one or more Modification Request (MR) numbers for the
new delta. When specifying more than one MR number on the command line,
.I mr-list
takes the form of a quoted, space-separated list. If
.B \-m
is not used and the standard input is a terminal,
.B delta
prompts with
.RB ` MRs? " '
for the list (before issuing the
.RB ` comments? " '
prompt). If the
.B v
flag in the
.BR s. file
has a value, it is taken to be the name of a program to validate the
MR numbers. If that validation program returns a non-zero exit status,
.B delta
terminates without checking in the changes.
.sp
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-o
Use the original time of the edited file for the delta time
when applying the delta.
In NSE mode this is the default behavior.
.sp
This option is a
.B SCHILY
extension that does not exist in historic
.B sccs
implementations.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-r\fR \fIsid\fR | \fB-r\fR\fIsid\fR\fR
When two or more versions are checked out, specify the version to check in. This \fBSID\fR value can be either the \fBSID\fR specified on the \fBget\fR command line, or the \fBSID\fR of the new version to be checked in as reported by \fBget\fR. A diagnostic
results if the specified \fBSID\fR is ambiguous, or if one is required but not supplied.
.ne 2
.TP
\fB\fB-y\fR[\fIcomment\fR]\fR
Supply a comment for the delta table (version log). A null comment is accepted,
and produces an empty commentary in the log. If
.B \-y
is not specified and the standard input is a terminal,
.B delta
prompts with
.RB ` comments? " '.
An unescaped NEWLINE terminates the comment.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-z
.ne 3
Enable CMF extensions for MR number handling.
.sp
This option is an undocumented
.B \s-1SUN\s+1
extension that does not exist in historic
.B sccs 
implementations.
.TP
.BI \-C dir
Specify the base directory for the
.B g-file
relative to the current working directory.
By default, the
.B g-file
is searched for in the current directory (independent from
the location of the 
.BI s. file\fR.
.ne 3
.TP
.B \-V
Prints the
.B delta
version number string and exists.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP

.BR environ (5)
for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the
execution of

.SH DIAGNOSTICS

Use the \fBSCCS\fR \fBhelp\fR command for explanations (see 
\fBsccs-help\fR(1)).
.sp

.SH WARNINGS

.LP
Lines beginning with an
.B ASCII SOH
character (binary 001) cannot be placed in the
.B SCCS
file if the 
.B SCCS 
v4 history file format is used, unless the
.B SOH
is escaped. This character has special meaning to
.B SCCS
(see 
.BR sccsfile (4))
and produces an error in
.B SCCS
v4 mode.
.B SCCS
v6 automatically esacapes such characters and thus allows
to use
.B ASCII SOH
at any place in a file.

.SH BUGS
The program
.BR delta (1)
is currently buggy while adding the SID specific checksum when a
.B SCCS\ v6
history file is used with the command
.RB ` "delta -g\c"
.I sid-list
.BI s. file\c
\&'.
This is because the SID specific checksum is computed
from the current
.I file
content, but
.RB ` "delta -g..." '
tells
.BR get (1)
to extract something different than what we checked in.
As
.BR get (1)
computes the checksum with the excluded SIDs, while
.BR delta (1)
computed the checksum with included SIDs,
it will encounter
a checksum misscompare.

.SH AUTHORS
The
.B SCCS
suite was origininally written by Marc J. Rochkind at Bell Labs in 1972.
Release 4.0 of
.BR SCCS ,
introducing new versions of the programs
.BR admin (1),
.BR get (1),
.BR prt (1),
and
.BR delta (1)
was published on February 18, 1977; it introduced the new text based
.B SCCS\ v4
history file format (previous
.B SCCS
releases used a binary history file format).
The
.B SCCS
suite
was later maintained by various people at AT&T and Sun Microsystems.
Since 2006, the
.B SCCS
suite is maintained by J\*org Schilling.
