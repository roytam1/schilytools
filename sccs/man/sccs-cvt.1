.SH NAME
sccs-cvt, sccscvt \- convert SCCS history files between v4/v6
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B
sccscvt
.B "[ options ]"
.I file1 .. filen
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Sccscvt
converts
.B SCCS\ v4
history files (as introduced in February 1977) into
.B SCCS\ v6
history files (as introduced in August 2011) and vice versa.
.LP
The first line, containing the SCCS magic number and the checksum is converted
to the format that is appropriate. The time format in the delta table is
converted by either removing the
.B SCCS\ v6
extensions or by adding time zone
information by assuming that all time stamps are from the local time zone. When
converting from
.B SCCS\ v6
to
.BR "SCCS\ v4" ,
the enhanced time stamp data is retained as
the first delta comment line in a delta block.
.LP
SID specific
.B SCCS\ v6
enhancements are converted into special delta comment to 
prevent information loss when converting to
.BR "SCCS\ v4" .
.LP
The
.B SCCS\ v6
enhancements that are between the
.B SCCS\ v4
flags indicated by
.B ^Af
and the SCCS comment block that is bracketed between
.B ^At
and
.B ^AT
are untouched as these enhancements are not flagged by historic SCCS versions
and retained by historic SCCS versions when a history file is modified.
.LP
If a file argument refers to a directory, the directory is scanned
for file names that start with ``s.'' and examines all these files.
. \" .SH RETURNS
. \" .SH ERRORS
.SH OPTIONS
.LP
.TP
.B \-d
When converting from
.B SCCS\ v6
to
.BR "SCCS\ v4" ,
discard the extended
.B SCCS\ v6
meta data instead of converting it into special
degenerated delta comments.
.TP
.B \-k
.TP
.B \-keep
Keep the original history file as
.BI o. file\fR.
When this option is missing, the original file is replaced by the
converted file.
.TP
.B \-V4
Convert a
.B SCCS\ v6
history file into a
.B SCCS\ v4
history file.
.TP
.B \-V6
Convert a
.B SCCS\ v4
history file into a
.B SCCS\ v6
history file.
.TP
.B \-help
Prints a short summary of the 
.B sccscvt
options and exists.
.TP
.B \-V
.TP
.B \-version
Prints the
.B sccscvt
version number string and exists.

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.sp
.LP
See
.BR environ (5)
for descriptions of the following environment variables that affect the
execution of
.BR sccscvt (1):
.BR LANG ,
.BR LC_ALL ,
.BR LC_CTYPE ,
.BR LC_MESSAGES ,
and
.BR NLSPATH .

.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B SCCS_NO_HELP
If set,
.BR sccscvt (1)
will not automatically call
.BR help (1)
with the SCCS error code in order to print a more helpful
error message. Scripts that depend on the exact error messages
of SCCS commands should set the environment variable
.B SCCS_NO_HELP
and set
.BR LC_ALL=C .

.br
.ne 4
.TP
.B TZ
Used for the timezone when converting between
.B SCCS\ v4
and
.BR "SCCS\ v6" .

.SH EXIT STATUS
.sp
.LP
The following exit values are returned:
.sp
.ne 2
.TP 5
.B 0
Successful completion.
.sp
.ne 2
.TP
.B 1
An error occurred.
.sp
.ne 2

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.SH NOTES
If a SCCS history file is converted from
.B SCCS\ v4
to
.B SCCS\ v6
and there is no
retained
.B SCCS\ v6
timestamp information in the delta comment, it may be a good
idea to manually correct time zone information.
