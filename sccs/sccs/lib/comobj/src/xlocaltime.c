 * 2038/01/19 03:14:07 GMT:
 *
 * 1932/11/26 18:31:44 ... 2038/01/19 03:14:07 => normal case
 * 2038/01/19 03:14:08 ... 2068/12/31 23:59:59 => map to 1901/12/13 - 1932/11/25
 *
 * As (within the same century) every 28th year looks the same, we subtract
 * either 883612800 (28 years) or 1767225600 (56 years) from a time past
 * 2038/01/19 03:14:07 to make it a positive integer time_t for conversion.
 * Then the year is corrected. This however requires not to change daylight
 * saving rules past year 2010 to be correct for the functions
 * localtime()/mktime().
 * For this reason, the russian TZs are already known to fail for the last
 * months in Y2039 as russia decided to abandon winter time in 2011.
 *
 * POSIX requires timezones -24 through +25
 * +25 Hours -> 90000 0x15f90
