*	Diagnostic messages for the 'prt' command
*
-1
"i not allowed with s"
You can't use both the -i and -s arguments on the same val command.

The option -i tells prt to print all included serial numbers while
the option -s tells prt to print only the first line of the delta table.
This is in conflict.
-2
"c not allowed with r"
You can't use both the -c and -r arguments on the same val command.

Cutoff time (the arg to -c) and SID (the arg to -r) both specify
a release in different ways. This is why they are conflicting
options.
