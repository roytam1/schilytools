The SCCS help facility provides limited
information about SCCS commands and
error messages, respectively.  Most
SCCS error messages provide a code (in
parentheses) that you can use as an
argument to help.

    help [ <msg-code>|<sccs-command> ]

Other help parameters to get an overview:

    help sccs_subcmds
    help get_kywds
    help prs_kywds

More information about sccs commands
can be found in the ``SunOS Reference
Manual,'' or by using the "man" command.
Man pages for SCCS commands have an
"sccs-" prefix.  To do a man on the
SCCS help command, type:

    man sccs-help

If the message includes a system error
number, refer to Intro(2), for
information about the error that
occurred.  In some cases, SCCS will
fail when attempting to write on a file
system that has been mounted
read-only.
