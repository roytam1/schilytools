*	Messages common to more than one SCCS command.
*
-1
"unknown key letter"
You supplied a keyletter which the command does not recognize.
-2
"key letter twice"
You supplied a keyletter more than once.
-3
"missing file arg"
You left off the name of the file to be processed.
-4
"cannot create lock file"
There are two known reasons why this can occur.

1) Someone else is updating the SCCS file (or the p-file).
   You'll have to wait until they're through, and try again.

2) You do not have write permission in the directory where the
   SCCS file resides.  If this is so, you are not allowed to
   create any files (including the ``lock file'') in that
   directory.

If it is neither of the two reasons and the problem persists, contact
your Source Code Administrator (SCA).
-5
"bad date/time"
The date/time must be a legitimate date/time in the form
"YY[MM[DD[HH[MM[SS]]]]]".  The program knows about things
like leap years, so be precise.
-6
"no id keywords"
No SCCS identification keywords were substituted for (or found).
If this message came from delta then you just tryed to make a
delta without any keywords.

If this message came from get then
your source code administrator blew it.
Complain to him/her.

If this message came from admin,
you blew it.
-7
"No id keywords"
No SCCS identification keywords were substituted for.
You may not have any keywords in the file,
in which case you can ignore this warning.
If this message came from delta then you just made a
delta without any keywords.
If this message came from get then
the last time you made a delta you changed the lines
on which they appeared.
It's a little late to be
telling you that you messed up the last time you made a delta, but this is
the best we can do for now, and it's better than nothing.

If you do not like to expand keywords at all and if you do not like to get
a warning for that case, you may like to call "admin -fy ..."

This isn't an error, only a warning.
-8
"value after ... arg"
You had something after the indicated keyletter argument and you weren't
supposed to.
-9
"User ID not in password file ..."
You are apparently running on a system on which you do not
have a login (via a data link of some type).  SCCS will
not allow you to make changes to a file if your user ID is not
located in the password file.
-10
"invalid id keywords"
The specific id keywords specified to admin via -fi"string"
were not found in the file.  You are trying to delta
a file with expanded keywords, get a file which was admin'd
to verify keywords after the last delta, or admin a new file
whose keywords do not match what was specified by "string".
-11
"cannot get project home directory"
Outdated error code, call "sccs help co32"
-12
"path conversion error"
A path could not be converted into a normalized path without
"./" or ".." components and without symbolic links.
-13
"resolved path too long"
The resolved path name is too long for further processing.
-14
"directory specified as s-file"
A directory was specified as s-file when only plain files were expected.
-15
"file not in supported time range"
A file uses a time stamp that is out of the supported range.
This is most likely a result of a bad time stamp on a file.
-16
"cannot change directory"
Cannot change directory while normalizing path name in project set mode.
Check directory permissions.
-17
"not in tree"
The path name is not inside the tree below the change set home directory.
-18
"too many file args"
The command or operation does not support more than one argument.
-19
"time stamp conversion error"
A time stamp is out of the supported range.
This is most likely a result of a time stamp that is not supported by the
conversion routines from the actual operating system.
-20
"non directory specified as argument"
A non-directory was specified when only directories were expected.
-21
"input file is missing"
A specified input file could not be found.
-22
"could not make directory"
A missing directory could not be made.
-23
"recursive dead lock attempt"
An attempt was made to create a lock file we did already create.
This would cause a deadlock situation and is an implementation bug.

Please report this problem.
-24
"parent dead lock attempt"
An attempt was made to create a lock file that was
already created by our parent.
This would cause a deadlock situation and is an implementation bug.

Please report this problem.
